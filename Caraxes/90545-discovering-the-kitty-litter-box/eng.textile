This story follows the character Bianca Campagna, the sister of Carrie from The Last Year Before They Grew Up

, and gives the backstory on how she was so prepared in the New Years Chapter.

I had writer's block so I figured I’d write it out.

—————

“C’mon Bianca, five reps left!” Liza called excitedly from next to the squat rack.

Bianca groaned, sweat dropping down her forehead and stinging her eyes. She tried to lower herself into a squat once again but her thighs were burning from her previous sets and her body was screaming at her to stop as she went to stand again. Unwilling to yield to the weight, Bianca dug into her reserves and forced herself to extend her legs back to her full height of 5’2.

The petite Italian was in very good shape, having started putting a major focus on her fitness at the start of the COVID pandemic nearly 3 years prior. Recently she had been taking even more advantage of the great gym facilities at Boston College where she was completing her Masters in Biotechnology. Her workout regimen had improved and she was seeing the results in the form of lean muscle being packed on to her small physique. With her dyed blonde hair and voluptuous ass, Bianca was beginning to feel much more confident that she used to.

As she lowered herself into yet another squat, Bianca felt her stomach gurgling as her muscles strained. When she went to raise the weight again, forcing her quivering thighs to obey her, a soft yet audible fart slipped past her butt cheeks and into her black leggings.

“Did you just fart?” Kat asked surprised, doing her best to suppress a laugh at her friend’s unplanned release.

Blushing bright red, Bianca nodded. Sometimes when she overtaxed her body and pushed it to new limits, she would find her bowels struggling to keep up. She wasn’t sure if it was because of the strain in all her other muscles causing her bowels to relax but she did know that it had a very rapid effect on her. Her post-workout shits had been massive and overwhelming lately, and once she started farting she never had more than twenty minutes before an explosion.

Gritting her teeth, Bianca quickly pumped out her remaining reps. With a sigh of relief, she deposited the bar back into the squat rack and grabbed her water bottle. Taking a large swig, she savoured the cold water against the inside of her throat.

“Great job B!” Kat exclaimed, impressed by her friend’s sheer grit. Bianca knew she had inspired Kat to start coming to the gym more which she was proud of, but she really didn’t want to start a post-workout conversation with her while she needed to take a dump.

“Thanks Kat,” Bianca replied, smiling in an attempt to hide her desperation. “I’d love to stay and chat while you finish up your set but I gotta bounce! I need to go meet Fabio for dinner.”

“No worries, boyfriends are always impatient. I’ll see you here at the same time tomorrow?” Kat asked.

“Of course!” Bianca replied, making a beeline for the door. She felt badly lying to her friend about an imaginary dinner date but her boyfriend was the perfect excuse to get her out of there. In reality, Fabio was probably back at her apartment in the student ghetto doing some homework but Kat didn’t need to know that.

As she tapped her student card to exit the gym and nodded to the attendant at the front desk, Bianca felt another soft fart slip out of her butt. Rushing onwards to avoid being associated with the smell, Bianca pushed through the door into the women’s change-room. The change-room was relatively empty, with only a shirtless black girl with red leggings checking her locker and a slightly heavier blonde toweling off after a shower. Bianca averted her eyes in an attempt to give them some privacy and made her way straight for the bathrooms across the tiled floor.

Hurrying through the doorway into the bathroom, Bianca was greeted by caution tape on the 3 stalls. Not quite believing what she was seeing, Bianca looked around frantically for any kind of explanation for why the bathrooms were closed. After a few seconds of scanning, she spotted a piece of paper taped over the sink that read “Closed due to pipes leaking”. Dancing on the spot, the petite blonde caught herself pondering using the closed toilets anyways. Scolding herself, Bianca raced out of the bathroom in the direction of her locker.

Stomach gurgling angrily, Bianca fumbled with her combination lock on her locker. Sweat was running down her face and she was struggling to focus, inputting the code wrong 3 times in a row. Finally, after a desperate fourth attempt, the lock clicked and the door swung open. Bianca was starting to panic as she felt a log trying to slide out of her anus. She was no longer confident she could reach a bathroom in time as the desperation was starting to overwhelm her.

Grabbing her stuff, the blonde made the choice to rush straight to her apartment without changing. Glancing down at her black leggings and pink sports bra, she grimaced at their sweaty feel against her body. She was going to enjoy her shower a lot after she got home.

“Are you okay?” the topless black girl asked randomly.

Bianca realized she’d been bobbing up and down in desperation as she packed her bag with her water bottle and headphones. Mortified that someone had noticed her fidgeting, she blushed and turned to face the stranger.

“Yeah, I’m okay! I just really need a bathroom. The protein shake is hitting,” she joked.

“OH EM GEE I get it completely girly. Protein shake shits are no joke,” the black girl sympathized. “It’s ridiculous that the bathroom here is closed but I think there’s a bathroom open in the library.”

Bianca swore silently under her breath. “That’s like 5 minutes in the opposite direction. Thanks, but I think I’m going to book it home.”

“It’s always a slay to use your own toilet instead of public,” the stranger agreed. “Do you live far?”

“No, I don’t live more than an eight minute walk.” As Bianca said this, her stomach gurgled and yet another fart slipped out. This fart was quite potent, filling the air with a strong earthy scent.

“Oh girly, get out of here fast! That stinks!” the stranger encouraged in a comforting tone. “Don’t wait around and have an accident.”

“Oh god, let’s not manifest that!” Bianca said as she threw her bag over her shoulders and scurried towards the change-room door. She’d never had an accident after the age where she had got out of diapers and she didn’t plan on doing so now.

Throwing open the door, Bianca began rushing through the route that she frequented every day from her gym to her apartment. Out through the gym lobby, around the side of the building, cutting through the beaten path between the gym and the climbing facilities, then making her way west across the edge of campus. As the smell of freshly cooked hot dogs wafted into her nose from the vendor who always parked his cart on campus, Bianca felt sick to her stomach. The thought of food was repulsive as her stomach rumbled with desperation.

Bianca picked up her pace as another fart escaped, barreling past groups of students playing ultimate frisbee on the lawns in front of the engineering buildings. She could feel the first log threatening to slide out into her grey thong, and her mind wandered to the expression “touching cloth”. She had never really considered how accurately it could describe the sensation but this was the feeling that she was experiencing at the moment. The tip of her poo was pushing gently into the seat of her panties.

Starting to panic, the petite blonde jammed her left hand into her bum and was unpleasantly surprised to feel the tip of the log through the fabric against her palm. She was still at least four minutes from her apartment and she had begun to worry that she wouldn’t make it.

Reaching the edge of campus, Bianca danced back and forth at the corner waiting for the light to change. Finally, spying a gap in traffic, the blonde resorted to jaywalking to get across quicker as she darted behind a city bus filled with students.

Conscious that she was on display, Bianca couldn’t care less at this point and her hand remained jammed into her bum. She could see a few surprised looks through the bus’ thick glass windows but for the most part no one paid her any mind.

Bianca hurried down the street as quickly as her petite legs could carry her. Rushing past the green grocer and the convenience store, she felt the poop threatening to explode out of her and she groaned at the pressure in her bowels. Finally, the large stone apartment building that she called home appeared at the end of the block and she made her way directly to the front door. Bianca threw open the front door to the lobby of her building and rushed to the inner door that led to the elevators. Fumbling around in her bag, she managed to fish out her key card and tap it on the card reader. The click of the door almost made her cry in relief and she immediately shoved through it.

Knowing that she couldn’t stand still in the elevator without shitting herself, Bianca rushed to the stairwell and shot up the stairs like a rocket. Her hand was still firmly planted on her ass and she could feel the poop sliding out more and more. As she reached her floor, she threw open the door and rushed down the hall towards her apartment. The key card was still clasped in her free hand and she quickly used it to open the door.

As she entered the apartment, her cat Mr Whiskers jumped off the couch and made his way towards her. Ignoring him completely, Bianca scrambled to kick off her shoes before heading straight for the bathroom down the hall. As she moved, she hooked her thumbs into the waistband of her black leggings and began to slide them off her shapely ass and down her toned thighs. Already she was imagining the feeling of collapsing backwards onto the toilet and releasing control of her bowels. She could practically hear the plop of her turds hitting the water, the sigh as she finally relaxed…

To her horror, as she reached the bathroom door, Bianca was shocked to find it closed. Grabbing the door handle, she was disturbed to find that it didn’t turn in her grasp. Jiggling it violently, she called through the door.

“Fabio, if you’re in there you better hurry the fuck up!”

“Jeez Bianca, it’s nice to hear your voice too!” her boyfriend Fabio replied sarcastically from beyond the door. “Give me a minute, I’m just finishing up.”

“I don’t have a minute,” Bianca screamed, anger bubbling up inside of her. She was quite the sight, drenched in sweat with her black leggings bunched around her knees, a slight bulge in the back of her grey thong.

Prancing in a small circle in front of the door, Bianca gasped in surprise as she felt the log start to slide out once again. The blonde desperately tried to prevent it but much to her cage in there seemed to be no way to stop. With a soft moan, Bianca stood there helplessly as the first small log broke off into her panties.

Thinking on her feet, Bianca tried to think of somewhere - anywhere! - where she could poop before she totally humiliated herself. Suddenly, inspiration literally brushed up against her leg. Mr Whiskers rubbed up against her, pushing his feline face into the back of her calf. Her knees threatened to buckle from the slight touch but she now knew where she could poop.

Rushing two doors further down the hall, Bianca careened into her office. She threw open the door, revealing a tiny cramped space that she mostly used for studying and occasionally gaming on her laptop. There was a desk against the far wall that was covered in stacks of paper and a bookshelf on one side of the room. On top of the bookshelf was a small lamp that was emitting a warm orange glow. Most importantly for Bianca’s desperate mind, under the desk was Mr. Whisker’s kitty litter box which stank of urine. It had been awhile since she cleaned it due to her own laziness.

“Holy fuck, this is so embarrassing,” Bianca muttered to herself as she reached under her desk for the kitty litter box. Sliding it into the middle of the room, Bianca was frantically dancing out of control. Reaching down, the petite blonde grabbed her bunches up leggings at her knees and yanked them down to her ankles. In a heartbeat, she was squirming around in nothing but her grey thong and pink sports bra, the thong bulging with a log of poo held tightly against her bum.

Squatting over the litter box, Bianca hurriedly yanked down her panties while making sure to tip the contents into the grey litter powder within. Sneaking a look down, Bianca could see that the log was pretty solid and a dark rich brown. This desperation had definitely been caused by the protein and her very full bowels, there was no excusing it.

With one final loud moan, Bianca was finally able to relax her bowels over the kitty litter. Sweat pouring down her face, she let the sensation wash over her as logs of poop rushed out of her anus. The first one hit the powder with a soft thud and broke off, allowing the next to telescope out behind it. Soon, a pile of six human turds was nestled in and among her cat’s waste.

Quickly, relief turned to shame at what she’d just done. Bianca realized that she’d lost control, started shifting her pants and resorted to pooping like a domesticated animal. Despite her best attempts to hold back the floodgates, Bianca felt tears well up in her big brown eyes. Soon, she was crying silently on the floor of her office, nude from the waist down.

From down the hall, she heard Fabio call out. “Bianca, I’m out of the washroom!”

Rising to her feet and wiping tears from her eyes, Bianca absolved to ensure that Fabio never found out. Shoving the kitty litter box back under her desk, she yanked up her underwear and leggings and prepared to face her boyfriend.
