The Seven Accidents of April’s Mom

This story is a spin off from The Last Year Before They Grew Up and will follow Sarah and April Dalton’s mom on some escapades through her younger days. No prior reading is necessary. It will repurpose a number of anthologies I have written that I wasn’t quite sure what to do with.

Part 1: The Uncomfortable Journey

Many people butt heads with their parents, and April Dalton was no different. Ever since she had been a little girl, April hadn’t seen eye to eye with her mother. While her mother was a strict rule follower who valued patience, forethought and tact, April had always been a wild child who was impatient, impulsive and blunt. These fundamental personality differences led them to clash on many matters, ranging from April’s academics to her relationships.

April’s older sister, Sarah, had always been much better at finding common ground with their mother, and although April had attempted to follow her example she consistently fell short. April was slowly growing to accept that she and her mom would never be close, as much as it pained her.

Now as the start of yet another school year approached and April loaded the car for her third year of university, she couldn’t help but dread the prospect of the three hour drive to Greatwestern University alone with her mom.

Carefully piling her suitcases and rucksacks in a suitable configuration in the back of her mom’s SUV, April vented her concerns to her best friend Jubilee in her SONY headphones.

“I don’t know how I’m going to do this, Jubilee!” April groaned. “I know she’s going to ask about my academics and pressure me to join more clubs this fall. She’s just going to push and push for three hours and I’m going to die.”

“I know,” Jubilee replied emphatically. “But in three hours you’ll be free of her until Thanksgiving. You finally won’t be feuding with her for the first time in months.”

April knew her best friend was right. She and her mom had clashed all summer over the stupidest most minuscule topics, and a bit of space would do them both well. Their relationship had worsened when April had failed most of her first year courses and had been forced to transfer to Greatwestern, but she was looking to make amends. She really had done her best to right herself.

“Thanks for the support, I appreciate the positive outlook,” April said to her best friend on the other end of the line. “I know you’re right, but I’m just dreading this car ride. We never have anything to talk about and I can never seem to relate to her.”

“I understand, but you have to try to open up to her too,” Jubilee said sagely. “Maybe if you’re vulnerable with her, she’ll be vulnerable with you.”

“As if,” April thought, rolling her eyes at her friend’s optimism. She hadn’t even managed to come out as queer to her mom despite being out of the closet to most important people in her life for awhile now.

“I’ve gotta go, my mom says we need to be on the road by 10 AM to beat the move-in traffic, but thanks for letting me vent,” April said to Jubilee. “Let’s chat in a few days.”

“Sounds good, text me how the ride goes,” Jubilee said, before disconnecting the call.

April lowered the headphones around her neck and breathed in the fresh air. Reaching up, she slammed closed the trunk of her mom’s SUV before turning and walking back towards the house.

April believed that today was going to be a mentally exhausting day, but she didn’t realize how enriching the car ride would be for her relationship with her mom.

————- 1 hour later —————

Despite leaving at 10 AM, they did not dodge traffic. A bumper to bumper stoppage stretched as far as the eye could see down the interstate and April fidgeted in her seat, sipping her now lukewarm coffee.

April was dressed in grey sweatpants and a navy blue hoodie that hid her curves. The wasian girl had had a bit of a growth spurt this summer, making her an inch taller than her older sister at 5’8. She had opted not to wear a bra for comfort and her dark brown hair was tied up in a messy bun. She had kicked off her white runners and tucked her socked feet up under her, as she scrolled through her Instagram feed on her phone.

Next to her, at the wheel, sat her mom, Mary Jane Dalton. Mary Jane was 51 years old and still in excellent shape for her age. She was white, with greying brown hair and she stood taller than her daughter at 5’9. She had dressed surprisingly formal for the car ride, in black slacks and a pink blouse that cling tight to her body and emphasized her large posterior and shapely cleavage.

“Anything interesting on the ‘gram sweetie?” Mary Jane asked her daughter.

“Mommm, don’t call it the ‘gram,” April complained. “And no, you’d hate everything on my feed.”

“No I wouldn’t dear, I’m still pretty hip,” Mary Jane replied, inching the car forward. “I have Instagram too you know.”

April knew, and loathed this fact. Her mom exclusively posted embarrassing pictures of the family and constantly tried to comment on April’s posts. April always had to delete the comments as fast as possible.

Opting to sigh and roll her eyes instead of reply, April ended the conversation.

As she did so, April felt a twinge in her bladder. The coffee she had been slowly sipping over the last hour was making itself known, and April shifted in her seat to get more comfortable. She knew the traffic was so bad that she’d likely be waiting awhile, and that she should likely lay off the liquids. Nevertheless, she raised her cup to her lips and took one more sip, before slipping her headphones on and cranking up her podcast about whales.

—————

April awoke suddenly, her mouth patched and her cheek pressed against the cold window of the car. Her eyes blinked open, blinded by the bright sunlight shining in. She sat up, and glanced at the clock to see that another hour had passed since she’d last checked. As she shifted awake, she felt a sudden pulse from her bladder and realized she really had to pee.

“Wakey wakey sweetie,” Mary Jane said. “You dozed off for about an hour and you even started snoring.”

“Mom!” April said. “You better not have filmed it!”

“I thought about it,” Mary Jane teased, “but I didn’t want to end up dead on the interstate if you found out.”

April chuckled at the joke and glanced at the still stopped traffic. “Speaking of the interstate, have we gone far?”

“Only about ten miles, why?” Mary Jane inquired. “Do you need a rest stop break?”

“A little bit,” April admitted, not wanting to let on how much she actually needed to go. She could feel the liquid sloshing back and forth inside her and her belly was bloated underneath her sweater.

“Don’t worry, so do I,” Mary Jane agreed. “We passed a sign saying the next rest stop is in 17 miles so if traffic picks up we should be there soon.

“But what if traffic doesn’t pick up?” April blurted. Her mom had a way of staying so positive and always assuming the best, but sometimes things just didn’t work out.

Mary Jane didn’t even blink at the retort. “Then we find another way to pee. I think I have a plastic back in the second row, and we could dump it out the window.”

April stared at her mom, dumbfounded. “That’s disgusting, and there’s no way we could pee in a bag without it leaking or spilling everywhere!”

Mary Jane smiled, her warm brown eyes full of mirth. “Trust me sweetie, it’d be better than peeing our pants.”

April froze, wondering if her mom somehow knew she’d wet herself the winter before. It was impossible, as no one knew except her friend Victoria, but April couldn’t help but worry.

“Oh please mom, there’s no way you know what it’s like to pee your pants,” April shot back to disguise her moment of concern. “You’re too perfect.”

“I was young once too,” Mary Jane replied, “And I’ve made my fair share of mistakes.”

“They aren’t mistakes if you’re five,” April said sassily, before shifting to adjust for the rising pressure in her bladder.

Mary Jane took note of her daughter’s fidgeting but opted not to comment on it for the time being. “Oh I wasn’t five, that’s for sure. I didn’t always make the best decisions when I was your age.”

“My age?” April repeated incredulously. There was no way her mother had peed herself over the age of five, it went against every aspect of the image that April had built up of her.

“Yes sweetie, I was a bit wild in college,” Mary Jane nodded. “And after too, to be honest…”

“After?!” April couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “You’ve had multiple accidents? You were wild? What are you talking about?”

She eyed her mother up and down, taking in the freshly ironed blouse and the pressed slacks. She simply could not picture her mom as wild when even her outfits for long car rides were above average.

“I wasn’t always your mom,” Mary Jane said, giggling to herself. “I was a college student and a young professional and I made a ton of mistakes. In fact, I’ve peed myself seven different times in adulthood.”

April gasped, her hand shooting to her crotch as a leak threatened to escape from the surprise. She squeezed tightly against her vagina which was warm to the touch even through her sweatpants. She could feel the satin of her panties, sleek and smooth beneath the fabric, and prayed they wouldn’t be getting damp any time soon.

“Are you okay sweetie?” Mary Jane finally asked. “You look like you’re absolutely bursting!”

“I… I am,” April confessed, her hand still in her crotch. If this traffic doesn’t move soon, I may have to use the plastic bag.”

“Don’t worry, I get it, I’ve been there,” Mary Jane said sympathetically.

“I simply don’t believe you and I don’t appreciate you lying to me as a way of getting me to open up!” April spat suddenly. All her insecurities about her relationship with her mom were bubbling to the surface in her moment of weakness.

Mary Jane was taken aback by the outburst. “I’m not lying and I’m not trying to get you to open up. I’ve actually peed myself seven times, and they were all incredibly embarrassing. Why are you so opposed to the idea that I’m a human being?”

April was about to retort but then she thought better. “I’m sorry… I think I bring a lot of my own baggage to your attempts to connect with me. I appreciate you trying.”

“I understand dear, and I’ll do my best not to bombard you with information about my past in the future,” Mary Jane said, but April could see the hurt in her expression. She clearly was actually trying.

“No, no,” April blurted, kicking herself for shutting down the moment of connection. “I want to hear about your past! Tell me about your accidents.”

Mary Jane flushed bright red. “Um, not sure if that’s the part of my past that I want to tell you about.”

“Oh, sorry!” April said, fidgeting in her seat. “Obviously start with whatever you’d like.”

Mary Jane looked her daughter up and down, taking in the hand pressed into her crotch. “Honestly, maybe today is the day for a bit of vulnerability. I’ll tell you about my accidents.”

The traffic outside the car had ground to a complete halt and a few raindrops had begun to patter off the windshield. Mary Jane turned to her daughter, smiling.

“Let me start by telling you about just after my 18th birthday, the summer before I went off to college…”

*004*2024-12-16 02:24

I’m glad you guys liked Part 1, it’s only a tease of what’s to come! Here’s a bit more meat…

Part 2: Coming of Age

“So all of high school I had a crush on this guy, Lawrence Andrews,” Mary Jane Dalton said to her daughter, as they sat on the interstate in stationary traffic. Grey clouds streaked the sky outside the car and some fat beads of rain continued to hit the windshield and roll down it.

“His name was Lawrence? Immediate ick,” April replied teasingly, shifting in her seat from her need to pee. They had been travelling for over two hours to move April into school, and they still weren’t even halfway.

“Trust me, he was really cute. He had big brown eyes and bushy blonde hair… honestly he was exactly your sister’s type,” Mary Jane assured her. April sighed, shifting in her seat and then bit her lip as a sharp reminder of her need to pee gnawed at her. It wasn’t bad yet, but it was getting there.

Mary Jane continued, glancing at her daughter with a small smile. “Anyways, it was the week after my eighteenth birthday. I had this plan to finally kiss him on our grad skip day. Everyone had gone down to Mill Creek, a popular swimming spot near town, and I was determined to make it happen. So, of course, I dressed my best—tight jeans, a cute blouse, everything. But… I forgot the most important part.”

“What?” April asked, half-distracted as she squirmed in her seat, her legs squeezing together.

“I didn’t pee before we left.” Mary Jane paused dramatically, chuckling at her own memory. “The day started off fine. We were all hanging out, and I was talking to Lawrence—well, mostly giggling like an idiot while he talked about some band he liked. But slowly… I started to feel it.”

“Feel what?”

“The urge.” Mary Jane gave April a pointed look. “And it wasn’t like I could just walk away and pee in the bushes or something, not with everyone there, not with him there. So I figured, ‘I can wait. It’ll go away.’ But it didn’t. I got more and more desperate as the day went on. Every time I laughed, every time someone splashed water from the creek, it got worse.”

April cringed, her own need becoming more pressing as she thought about the flowing creek. “So what happened?”

“Well, by the time we were about to leave, I was standing next to Lawrence, my legs crossed, trying so hard not to let on how badly I had to go. And wouldn’t you know it? That’s when he finally noticed me.” Mary Jane sighed. “He asked if I wanted to go for a walk—alone, just the two of us.”

April raised an eyebrow. “And you went?”

“Of course I went! I wasn’t going to pass up my chance after liking him for four years. So we wandered off down this little trail by the water, and I’m trying to look cool, but every step was like torture. I was bouncing around, doing everything I could to hold it in. I thought he’d notice, but he didn’t say a word. We kept walking, and finally, we stopped by this big oak tree.”

April leaned forward, despite her growing discomfort. “Then what?”

Mary Jane smiled softly. “He leaned in, and I swear my heart was about to burst out of my chest. It was like time slowed down. His hands brushed mine, and he lifted his other hand to touch my face. I was so distracted, I almost forgot how desperate I was. He kissed me, slow and soft, and I kissed him back, my hands sliding up into his hair. It was so warm, his lips soft against mine.”

April stared at her mom, momentarily forgetting her own urgency. “Wait, really? Mom, you had game!”

“Really,” Mary Jane said with a wink. “And then his hands wandered down, just lightly brushing my hips, pulling me closer. I could feel his breath, the closeness, and I didn’t want it to end. His fingers moved lower, gripping the waistband of my jeans, pulling me into him, and I swear my knees went weak. I was so wrapped up in it, but then—” She paused, laughing.

“No way,” April said, eyes wide. “You didn’t…”

“I did. Just a little,” Mary Jane admitted with a grin. “The tiniest bit escaped, and I panicked. I pulled away and mumbled something about needing to get back, but he just stood there, completely oblivious, smiling like I’d just made his day.”

April shook her head in disbelief. “That’s mortifying.”

“Believe me, it felt like it at the time. But you know what? It was also kind of hilarious looking back. And it didn’t stop me from kissing him again later. Not right then, though—I had to get out of there before I really embarrassed myself.”

April squirmed again, glancing out the window at the still unmoving traffic. “Well, now I really need to pee. Thanks, Mom.”

Mary Jane chuckled, giving her daughter a knowing smile. “You’re welcome.”

April shot her mom a skeptical look, her eyebrow arched. “Okay, hold up. There’s definitely more to that story, Mom. I can tell. You barely peed yourself and you said this was a story about you peeing yourself”

Mary Jane blushed, a small flush creeping up her neck, and she quickly shook her head. “No, that’s it. That’s the story, April.”

“Mom, come on,” April said, rolling her eyes. “You’re terrible at lying, and I know you’re holding back.”

Mary Jane let out a nervous laugh, her hands gripping the steering wheel a little tighter. “I’m not holding anything back. You’ve heard all the embarrassing parts already.”

“Seriously? That’s the worst you’ve got?” April crossed her arms, leaning back in her seat. “Because you look really guilty right now.”

There was a pause, and Mary Jane bit her lip, glancing out at the rain-soaked highway before letting out a defeated sigh. “Fine. Fine. There is… a little more. But you’re not going to like it.”

April leaned forward, eyes wide. “Oh my god, I knew it! Spill!”

Mary Jane shifted uncomfortably, her face turning a deeper shade of pink. “Well, after that kiss by the oak tree, we all started heading back. The plan was to drive home, right? Only problem was, when I got to my car, it wouldn’t start. Dead battery.”

April was grinning now, completely absorbed. “Oh no…”

“Oh yes,” Mary Jane muttered, still blushing. “So Lawrence offered to drive me home. And by this point, I was really desperate, like bouncing my legs while I stood there talking to him. But I couldn’t exactly tell him that, could I? So I figured, ‘Okay, the ride home is only about twenty minutes. I can make it.’”

“Of course you thought that,” April said, shaking her head. “Classic mistake.”

“Exactly. So I get into his car, and we start driving. And it’s a long drive, longer than I remembered. Every minute, my bladder’s screaming at me, and I’m sitting there, squeezing my legs together, trying not to squirm too obviously. Lawrence is chatting away, completely oblivious, and I’m just dying inside.”

April made a face, clearly imagining the scene. “Ugh, that sounds awful. But wait, you made it home, right?”

“Well… yes and no.” Mary Jane hesitated, rubbing the back of her neck. “We did make it to my house. But when we got there, Lawrence insisted on walking me to the door. I thought, ‘Okay, just get inside, run to the bathroom, and then you’ll be fine.’”

“But?”

“But as soon as I stepped through the door, he grabbed my hand and pulled me back toward him,” Mary Jane continued, her voice a little quieter now. “He kissed me again, right there in the entryway, and… well, I didn’t exactly want to stop him.”

April stared at her mom, mortified. “Mom, seriously?”

Mary Jane’s face was bright red now, but she pressed on. “I was so close to the bathroom, but I thought, ‘I’ll just wait a little longer. It’ll be fine.’ So instead of going, I kissed him back. And then it got a little… heated.”

April groaned, covering her face with her hands. “Oh my god. Please tell me you didn’t.”

“Well…” Mary Jane gave a sheepish smile. “We started pulling at each other’s clothes—his shirt, my blouse. Everything came off in a blur. He was just so… persistent. And I was, um, really into it, despite how much I still needed to pee.”

“No, no, no,” April moaned, her hands still over her face. “I don’t need this kind of detail, Mom!”

Mary Jane cringed, but a small part of her couldn’t help but laugh at her daughter’s reaction. “Well, you did ask for the whole story.”

“I didn’t ask for that part of the story!” April shot back, her face twisted in horror. “Oh my god, I can’t believe you just—ugh, I can’t believe this. I did not want to know how you got it on with some boy!”

Mary Jane chuckled, though her face was still flushed with embarrassment. “Look, it was a different time, and I was young! And, um, very distracted.”

“Clearly,” April muttered, shaking her head. “I can’t believe you almost peed yourself because you couldn’t stop making out with a guy.”

Mary Jane took a deep breath, clearly bracing herself to continue. “So, as I was saying… we were in the middle of it. Things were escalating fast, and we had quickly made our way into my bedroom. Lawrence was on top of me on my bed, his hands running up my sides, and my mind was torn between how intense it all felt and how much I still had to pee. But I figured I could wait—just a little longer. I didn’t want to stop.”

April groaned, sinking deeper into her seat, trying to hide behind her hands. “Please tell me this doesn’t get worse.”

Mary Jane winced. “I wish I could say that, honey, but… it does.” She paused, as if trying to decide whether to even continue, but then pressed on. “Right when we were fully caught up in the moment—like, mid-kiss, clothes off—I heard it. The front door. My mom, coming home early from work.”

April’s eyes widened in shock. “No way.”

“Yes, way,” Mary Jane said, clearly mortified by the memory. “I panicked. Lawrence panicked. We both froze, and I could hear my mom calling out, asking if I was home. I barely had time to think. Lawrence grabbed his pants and started frantically putting his clothes back on, but there was no way he could make it out the front door without running into her.”

April’s hands fell away from her face, her expression a mix of disbelief and horror. “So… what did you do?”

“Well,” Mary Jane said, cringing, “the only option left was the window. He scrambled to pull his jeans on and grabbed his shirt, while I shoved him toward the window. It wasn’t even that high off the ground, but I was so out of breath and panicked, I couldn’t think straight. I told him to go, and he practically dove out the window just as my mom started coming down the hallway.”

April let out a soft gasp, her face a mix of fascination and disgust. “Did she see him?”

“No, thank god,” Mary Jane replied, shaking her head. “But she heard me moving around, so she came straight to my room. I barely had time to pull the sheets up over myself. There I was, lying naked in bed, out of breath, still very desperate to pee. And then she barged in.”

April stared at her mom, completely horrified. “Grandma walked in on you? Naked?”

“Yeah,” Mary Jane said, rubbing her forehead, her face bright red now. “She walked in, took one look at me—sweaty, red-faced, gasping for air—and instantly knew something was off. But all I could focus on at that moment was how much I needed to pee. I was still trying to hold it in, squirming under the sheets. My mom was standing there, hands on her hips, staring at me like I’d committed some crime.”

April was practically speechless, her mouth slightly open. “Mom… that’s so messed up.”

“It was worse than you think,” Mary Jane continued, cringing at the memory. “I was sitting there, about to burst, trying to keep it together while my mom demanded to know what I’d been doing. I mumbled something about ‘just getting some air,’ but she didn’t buy it for a second. The longer she stood there, the worse it got. I could feel my bladder giving up, but I didn’t want to admit anything. I was too embarrassed.”

April could barely handle it, her hands back over her face as she muttered, “No, no, no. Don’t tell me you…”

Mary Jane took a deep breath, then nodded, her expression filled with embarrassment. “I couldn’t hold it anymore. I lost control. Right there, in front of her, I started peeing in my bed. It just… happened. I tried to stop it, but it was too late.”

April let out a strangled noise, her face buried in her hands. “Mom! What the hell?!”

“I know!” Mary Jane said, clearly horrified herself. “I threw off the sheets and leapt up, and then I was standing there, naked, out of breath, and literally peeing all over my bedroom floor. My mom just stood there, staring at me in total shock. I thought I’d never live it down.”

April shook her head, still unable to process it all. “That’s… I don’t even have words for how mortifying that is.”

“It was pretty bad,” Mary Jane agreed, her face flushed with embarrassment. “She didn’t say anything for a solid minute. Just watched. Then she finally snapped out of it and started yelling about what a mess I’d made. But all I could think about was how I’d managed to ruin my whole day. Pee was pooling between my toes on the hardwood floor and your grandma was staring as it streamed down my legs.

April groaned, burying her face deeper into her hands. “I can’t believe Grandma saw all of that.”

“Neither can I,” Mary Jane admitted with a sigh. “But it’s the truth. One of the most embarrassing moments of my life, and now you know all about it.”

April shook her head, still visibly shocked. “Well, at least now I know why you’re always so weird about making sure we go to the bathroom before leaving the house.”

Mary Jane let out a soft laugh, shrugging. “I guess it did leave a lasting impression.”

Part 3: Skimpy White Rompers

Twenty minutes later, the rain had worsened, turning into a relentless downpour that made the traffic situation even more unbearable. The car hadn’t moved an inch, and the only sound, aside from the drumming of rain against the roof, was the rhythmic swish of the windshield wipers battling against the sheets of water pouring down. April shifted uncomfortably in the passenger seat, her legs crossed tightly, bouncing one foot in agitation. Her need to pee was getting worse, and with no sign of traffic clearing, she was starting to feel seriously worried.

Mary Jane glanced over at her daughter, noticing the tense, squirming movements and giving her a sympathetic look. “How are you holding up?” she asked softly.

April shot her a frustrated glance. “Not great,” she admitted through gritted teeth. “I really, really have to go.”

Mary Jane sighed, then gave a small smile. “I know the feeling, believe me.” After a beat, she tilted her head thoughtfully. “You know, this actually reminds me of my second accident in adulthood.”

April groaned in disbelief, her eyes widening. “Mom! Another one? How many of your seven pee stories are you going to tell me today?”

Mary Jane laughed. “What can I say? Life happens. But this one’s not as bad as the last story, I promise. No… sexual elements or anything like that.”

April paused, then sighed, shifting in her seat. “Okay, fine. If it distracts me, go ahead. But please, no kissing, no windows, no boys.”

“Deal,” Mary Jane said with a grin. “This one’s from my college days, back when I was rushing a sorority at Greatwestern University. My best friend at the time, Glynis, and I were doing it together. She and I were inseparable back then.”

“Ugh, sororities,” April muttered, shaking her head. “Let me guess, you had to do some ridiculous task?”

“Oh, of course,” Mary Jane said, laughing. “The sorority had us doing all sorts of crazy things, but this one particular night was one for the books. It was part of a rush event, and they told us we had to deliver party invitations to a nearby frat house. But there’s the catch—we had to dress a certain way. They made us wear these little white rompers and put our hair in pigtails. It was… honestly, a bit embarrassing, but we were freshmen and willing to do just about anything to get in.”

April raised an eyebrow. “White rompers? Really?”

“Yup,” Mary Jane nodded, smiling at the memory. “It was the early 90s, so imagine those tight little white one-pieces that barely covered anything, and of course, Glynis and I had to wear them with strappy sandals and those ridiculous pigtails. We looked like total bimbos.”

April grimaced, but there was a hint of curiosity in her expression. “Wow. That sounds… something.”

“It was,” Mary Jane agreed. “But honestly, we looked really sexy. Glynis was this tall, leggy blonde with these curves that made everyone stare, and I… well, let’s just say I was in my prime back then. My brown hair was down to my waist, and I had a pretty decent figure myself.” She winked, and April cringed.

“Okay, I get it. You looked hot. Please don’t make me picture it any more than that.”

Mary Jane chuckled. “Fair enough. So, anyway, the night starts out with Glynis and I deciding it would be a good idea to pre-game before heading to the frat. We had this big bottle of cheap wine—like, really terrible stuff—and we drank nearly the whole thing between us.”

April groaned. “Oh no…”

“Yeah, we were definitely feeling it,” Mary Jane admitted, laughing. “We were stumbling all over the place by the time we left our dorm around 9 PM. The frat house wasn’t too far, but the problem was, this was before we had smartphones or GPS or anything. We had to rely on a piece of paper with the address written down, and neither of us could really read it because we were already tipsy.”

April shook her head, trying not to laugh. “This is already a disaster.”

“It was,” Mary Jane said, nodding. “So there we were, wandering around campus, stumbling down the sidewalk in our white rompers, giggling and trying to figure out where the hell this frat house was. And of course, the wine was starting to hit us in more ways than one.”

April raised an eyebrow, leaning forward a bit. “Let me guess… you both needed to pee?”

“Exactly,” Mary Jane said, grinning. “All that wine was catching up to us fast. At first, it was just a little urge, but the longer we wandered around, the worse it got. We couldn’t find the damn address, and every step was making it harder and harder to hold it in.”

April winced, clearly feeling the discomfort herself. “That sounds awful.”

“Oh, it was,” Mary Jane continued. “We were both squirming, and we couldn’t even find a bathroom anywhere. Every building we passed was either closed or too far out of the way. By the time we finally figured out we’d been walking in circles, both of us were really starting to panic. Glynis kept crossing her legs and saying she was about to pee her romper, and I wasn’t doing much better.”

April grimaced, glancing out at the rain. “So, what happened next? Did you find the frat house?”

Mary Jane sighed, a knowing smile playing on her lips. “Eventually… but let’s just say things didn’t go quite according to plan.”

Mary Jane continued the story with a small laugh, the memory of that chaotic night still vivid in her mind. “So, we were getting pretty desperate by this point. We’d been wandering around for what felt like forever, and neither of us had any idea where this frat house was. Glynis, being the eternal optimist, was convinced she knew a shortcut. She pointed to this small ravine that ran behind a bunch of houses just off campus. It was dark, and the streetlights didn’t reach that far, but she was absolutely sure it would cut our trip in half.”

April, despite her discomfort, was captivated by the absurdity of the story. “Oh no, I’m already sensing this is a bad idea.”

Mary Jane nodded, smirking. “You’re telling me. But, at the time, we were tipsy, desperate, and not exactly thinking clearly. So, of course, we went for it. We stumbled our way down a little dirt path, the woods around us getting darker and denser as we went. The trees were thick, and the ground started to slope down toward this ravine. It was a little eerie, to be honest, especially since we couldn’t see much in the dark except for what the moonlight showed us.”

April shifted uncomfortably in her seat, glancing at her mom. “And you still hadn’t found a bathroom?”

“Nope,” Mary Jane said, shaking her head. “We were both holding it, but barely. Glynis and I were doing those little pee dances the whole way down—crossing our legs, bouncing on our toes, stopping every few steps to squeeze our thighs together. It was honestly getting a little pathetic. The wine wasn’t helping either; it was just making us giggle even though we were about to burst.”

April groaned, her own desperation growing as she imagined the scene. “Ugh, that sounds miserable.”

“Oh, it was,” Mary Jane agreed. “But we kept going, figuring we could just make it to the frat and use their bathroom. Then we hit the embankment. It was this steep, muddy slope leading down into the ravine, and I don’t know what we were thinking, but Glynis insisted we could make it down. She took the lead, of course, trying to carefully step down the slope in those strappy sandals they made us wear with the rompers.”

April raised an eyebrow, smirking a little. “This sounds like it’s going to end badly.”

“Oh, it did,” Mary Jane said, laughing softly. “She took about three steps before her foot slipped out from under her. Next thing I know, Glynis is shrieking, sliding down the embankment on her butt, her legs flailing everywhere. She went straight through the mud, and by the time she hit the bottom, her entire romper was covered in it. Her bum was completely soaked with mud, her legs were caked in it, and her pigtails were all askew.”

April couldn’t help but giggle, despite herself. “Oh no! What did she do?”

“She just lay there for a second, whining about how her romper was ruined and how she was going to kill whoever had the bright idea for this stupid task,” Mary Jane said, grinning. “But the worst part was that she was still squirming, even while sitting there in the mud. She looked up at me and whined, ‘I have to pee so bad!’ It was like the fall made it even worse.”

April winced, her own discomfort mirroring the story. “I can’t imagine how much worse that would make it. Did you go down after her?”

Mary Jane sighed. “Yeah, I had to. I didn’t have much choice. She couldn’t get up on her own, and I couldn’t just leave her there. So I carefully picked my way down the slope—though I’ll admit, I wasn’t much more graceful than she was. My sandals kept slipping, and I was squirming the whole way down, trying not to lose control. I thought for sure one of us was going to end up peeing ourselves before we made it back up.”

Mary Jane cleared her throat, preparing to dive back into the story. “So, after Glynis’s little mudslide, I had to help her get back up. We were both pretty desperate by that point, and climbing that embankment was not easy. Every time we tried to pull ourselves up, the mud would just slip out from under us. Our sandals were useless, sliding all over the place, and we kept stumbling and grabbing at tree roots or anything we could find.”

April, still shifting uncomfortably in the passenger seat, let out a groan. “Oh my God, Mom, I seriously don’t know how much more of this I can take. I’m about to burst here!”

Mary Jane gave her daughter a sympathetic glance. “I know, sweetheart, but just try not to think about it. Focus on something else—anything else.”

“That’s easy for you to say!” April retorted, her legs tightly crossed as she pressed her hands against her thighs.

Mary Jane chuckled, trying to get back into the story. “Anyway, like I said, we were struggling to climb up the embankment. The mud was thick, and every time we thought we had a good grip, we’d slide back down. And of course, our desperation just kept getting worse. I was practically dancing on the spot, and Glynis kept muttering about how she wasn’t going to make it. She was completely over it, and I could see the panic in her eyes.”

April groaned again, clearly empathizing with the situation as she squirmed in her seat. “This is torture just listening to it!”

“Tell me about it,” Mary Jane said with a laugh. “It felt like we were trapped in that ravine forever. At one point, Glynis just stopped and grabbed my arm. She looked at me and said, ‘I can’t hold it anymore. I’m going to pee right here.’ And I could tell she wasn’t kidding. She was done.”

April shook her head in disbelief. “What did you do?”

“Well,” Mary Jane said, grinning at the memory, “she made me help her untie her romper because it was so tight in the back. So there I was, trying to loosen the knots with shaky hands, both of us squirming like crazy. Glynis was dancing from foot to foot, her legs crossing and uncrossing, and she kept saying, ‘Hurry, hurry!’ Finally, I managed to get the romper loose, and she slipped right out of it.”

April’s eyes widened, cringing at the visual. “Wait, she just… stripped?”

“Yep,” Mary Jane said, still laughing. “There she was, standing in nothing but a red thong, her long legs covered in mud, her arms flailing as she tried to hold it in. She was doing this full-on pee dance, her arms waving, her legs scissoring and her large, perfect breasts bouncing around like she was in some kind of frantic routine. She was so well endowed and I was quite envious of her back in those days. I couldn’t stop laughing—well, except I had to focus on not laughing too hard because, you know…”

April shuddered. “Gross, Mom.”

“But wait, it gets better,” Mary Jane continued. “Glynis eventually just pulled her thong down, crouched behind a bush, and let go. The relief on her face was priceless. She sighed like it was the best feeling in the world. Meanwhile, I was standing there, holding her muddy romper, squirming like crazy, and wishing I could go next. The second she squatted behind that bush, I heard it—the sound of her pee hitting the dirt. It was loud, like a fire hose, and she let out this huge, relieved sigh as it came out in full force.”

April grimaced in discomfort, pressing her legs together even tighter, but her mom kept going, caught up in the memory. “Glynis was squatting low, her long legs trembling from the effort of holding it in for so long. Her hands were pressed against the ground for balance, her arms a little shaky. Her head tilted back, and her messy pigtails dangled down. Her whole body relaxed, and it was clear she wasn’t worried about anything else in that moment—just pure relief. The pee just kept coming, splashing loudly on the dirt and leaves below.”

April covered her face with her hands. “Mom, I don’t need to hear about the sound!”

Mary Jane chuckled, glancing over at her daughter. “I’m telling you, it felt like she peed for an eternity. I was standing there, squirming and wishing I could trade places with her, but all I could do was watch. It was so unfair!” She shook her head, still amused. “But that moment of relief she had… yeah, I was more than a little jealous.”

April made a face, cringing again. “Ugh, no, no. Please, stop there. This is way too much detail.”

Mary Jane gave her an apologetic smile, clearly enjoying herself. “Sorry, sweetie. I guess I get carried away with the storytelling. But hey, it’s a pretty funny memory… now, at least.”

April shifted again, groaning. “I don’t know how much longer I can hold it. Can we please talk about anything else now?”

Mary Jane laughed. “Alright, alright, I’ll spare you any more details. But trust me, it’s a lot better looking back on it than it was when we were stuck in that ravine!”

April groaned, shifting again in her seat. “Please tell me this story has an end soon, because I swear I’m about to pee myself just listening to it!”

Mary Jane smiled sympathetically, placing a hand on April’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, sweetheart. We made it out eventually. But let me tell you, after watching Glynis get her relief, it made that climb back up the embankment even worse.”

April, exasperated, sighed. “Next time, maybe spare me the details about your friends… and their underwear.”

“Deal,” Mary Jane said with a wink. “But you’ve got to admit, it’s a funny story so far.”

April shot her mom a tired look. “Funny for you. For me? Torture.”

Mary Jane gave April a teasing glance, clearly amused by how much her daughter was squirming now. “So… do you want to hear about how I didn’t quite make it, even though Glynis did?”

April groaned, her cheeks flushing as she pressed her legs together. “Ugh, fine, but make it fast, Mom. I really can’t bear much more of this. I’m dying over here.”

With a grin, Mary Jane dove right back into the story. “Alright, alright. So, after Glynis finished her little pee break, we somehow managed to climb out of the ravine, muddy and completely exhausted. We finally spotted the frat house, and let me tell you, it wasn’t that far from where we’d been wandering the entire time. Of course, by this point, Glynis was a total mess—covered head to toe in mud, her romper was practically ruined. And me? I was a complete wreck, practically dancing on the spot. I could feel my bladder about to burst, but we thought we were finally in the clear.”

April squirmed again, biting her lip. “And then what happened?”

Mary Jane chuckled, recalling the moment. “Well, we knocked on the door, and this frat bro opened it. He looked us up and down—Glynis all muddy and me hopping from foot to foot. I handed him the invite, and he took his time reading it, like he didn’t care that I was clearly in distress. So finally, I asked if we could use the bathroom. And this guy? He got all weird about it, hemming and hawing like we weren’t trustworthy enough to use his precious frat house bathroom.”

April rolled her eyes. “Ugh, of course he did.”

“Right?” Mary Jane said, shaking her head. “I was on the verge of losing it, but Glynis—bless her—gave him this pitiful look, covered in mud and everything, and he finally gave in. He let us in, and we bolted for the bathroom. Glynis was trying to help me untie the knots in the back of my romper, but she was being so slow about it.”

April winced, imagining the scene. “And you were still holding it?”

“Desperately,” Mary Jane said, nodding. “I was squirming like crazy, crossing my legs, holding myself with one hand while she fumbled with the knots. It felt like she was taking forever, and I was starting to panic. I could feel the pressure building, and I knew I was seconds away from disaster.”

April cringed, shaking her head. “Mom, this is so stressful.”

“You’re telling me,” Mary Jane said, laughing softly. “Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore. I begged Glynis to hold me while I used both hands to try and get the knot undone myself.”

April’s eyes widened, her face a mix of shock and embarrassment. “You begged her to hold you? That’s… weird, Mom.”

Mary Jane shrugged, a playful smile on her lips. “Desperate times, April. Desperate times. And honestly, in the moment, it didn’t feel weird at all. I was so frantic, and the pressure was unbearable. When she pressed her hand against me, it was like this tiny bit of relief—just enough to buy me a few more seconds. But the whole time, my hands were fumbling with the knot, and I could feel my bladder just screaming at me.”

April’s face scrunched up in disbelief. “I can’t believe you’re telling me this.”

“Well, you asked for it,” Mary Jane teased. “So, I’m standing there, my fingers shaking as I try to get this stupid knot untied, and then… I felt it. My bladder just gave out. I couldn’t hold it anymore. It all came rushing out, and before I knew it, I was peeing—right through my romper, soaking Glynis’ hand.”

April’s jaw dropped, her face turning bright red. “Oh my God, Mom!”

Mary Jane laughed, the memory still vivid. “I was mortified, of course, but there was nothing I could do. The relief was overwhelming, but at the same time, I was just standing there, peeing uncontrollably while poor Glynis held on, completely soaked.”

Mary Jane continued, her voice taking on a slightly sheepish tone as she dove deeper into the memory. “So, as I stood there, losing control, the sound of my pee hitting the floor was unmistakable. It wasn’t just a little dribble; it was like a flood. It soaked right through my romper and started forming a puddle on the bathroom floor, spreading out slowly across the tiles.”

April cringed, pressing her knees together even tighter, but her mom kept going.

“Glynis—bless her heart—didn’t even pull her hand away at first. I think she was in shock. She just looked down at her damp hand, her eyes wide, like she couldn’t believe what was happening. Then, instead of freaking out, she tried to grab me tighter, thinking it would help somehow. She held me, whispering, ‘It’s okay, it’s okay,’ like she was my own personal cheerleader, even though I was practically drowning her hand at that point.”

April’s face twisted in disbelief. “She just… held on? Even after you started peeing all over her?”

“Yep,” Mary Jane said with a half-laugh, clearly still a little embarrassed by the memory. “She was a really good friend. But by that point, I was slumping into her, my knees giving out from the sheer relief. The more I relaxed, the more I just leaned into Glynis, and she wrapped her other arm around me, like she was trying to hold me up, even though I was making this huge mess. I could feel her hand pressing against me as I let go, completely giving in, and the puddle beneath us just kept growing.”

April shook her head, her face a mix of horror and disbelief. “That’s… so gross, Mom. I can’t believe you two didn’t just bolt for separate corners of the room.”

Mary Jane shrugged with a smile. “We were stuck together at that point—literally. But what can I say? Desperate times call for desperate measures. I never thought I’d be in a situation like that, but there I was, completely drained and standing in my own puddle with my best friend holding me.”

April groaned, covering her face. “I don’t know what’s worse—the fact that you’re telling me this or the fact that I can’t leave this car.”

Mary Jane laughed softly. “Hey, you said you wanted to hear the end, remember? But don’t worry, that’s the worst of it. We cleaned up as best we could after that… though I think the frat bro probably wondered why we were in there so long.”

April dropped her hands with a sigh. “Well, I’m definitely never asking for another one of your ‘accident’ stories ever again.”

Mary Jane just smiled, glancing at the rain-soaked windshield. “Fair enough. But you have to admit—it was memorable.”

April put her hands over her face, groaning in disbelief. “I can’t believe I just sat through that story.”

Mary Jane smiled, reaching over to give her daughter’s arm a comforting pat. “Hey, you asked for it. And trust me, it’s a lot funnier now than it was back then.”

April, still squirming, gave her mom a tired look. “Yeah, well, I guess I’ll just be glad I didn’t live through it.”

How about April’s mom tells her a story about how she wet herself when she was in a skintight dress with high heels, a very high collar, and an extremely tight corset and another time when she was at a BDSM club wearing a skintight latex catsuit, high heels and a painful corset. She should emphasize just how painful her outfits were and how it was nearly impossible to breathe and how hot and sweaty the outfits made her.

Thanks for the suggestion, I'll keep it in mind!

Part 4: Mary Jane on Mary Jane

Forty minutes later, the rain had worsened, and the traffic barely crawled along. They had moved maybe half a mile, and April was now curled into a fetal position in the passenger seat, her arms tightly wrapped around her legs, rocking slightly in discomfort.

“I can’t believe this,” April groaned, her voice shaky with desperation. “I’m going to pee myself in your car, Mom.”

Mary Jane, still sympathetic but trying to keep things light, glanced over at her daughter. “You don’t have to, sweetie. You could just use the coffee cup. No one will see. We’re stuck here, and it’s better than an accident.”

April grimaced, her face flushed with embarrassment. “I’m not going to pee in a cup. That’s humiliating.”

“Well, I’m not going to judge you,” Mary Jane said, holding up the empty cup encouragingly. “No one will know but us. It’s really not a big deal. You’ve heard worse stories from me today, anyway.”

April squeezed her eyes shut, her legs trembling as she rocked back and forth. The pressure in her bladder was unbearable, and despite her pride, she knew there was no other option. “Fine,” she mumbled through clenched teeth. “But you have to look away. And talk about something. Anything.”

Mary Jane handed her the cup, then turned her head away, staring out the driver’s side window. “Alright, I’ll keep you distracted. Let me tell you about this one time in Amsterdam. It was a trip I took with some girlfriends, and we ended up staying in this really crappy hostel right near the Red Light District. The place was so sketchy, the walls were paper-thin, and there was a broken window that we had to tape shut with duct tape. I was on edge the whole time, and on the second night, one of my friends convinced me to try marijuana for the first time—”

April carefully pressed the rim of the cup to her lower lips, biting her lip as she willed herself to relax. The sound of her mom’s story was just enough to drown out her own sense of embarrassment, as her sweatpants and panties sat around her ankles on the floormat beneath her shoes. She closed her eyes, focusing on the relief as she finally let go, the warm pale yellow liquid streaming into the cup.

Her body sagged slightly as the pressure eased, the stream thundering into the paper walls, and for a moment, she felt a huge sense of relief—until she realized the cup was quickly filling. Her eyes shot open in panic, watching as the level of urine rose higher and higher in the small cup.

“Mom!” April hissed, interrupting her. “The cup’s almost full!”

Mary Jane glanced over briefly, then quickly turned her head back, trying to keep her daughter calm. “Okay, just stop for a second. Take a deep breath.”

April managed to cut off the stream, but her bladder was still painfully full. She had only been able to empty about a third of it into the cup, and now she was left sitting there, still desperately needing to go but unable to continue.

“I can’t believe this,” April muttered, holding the now nearly full cup carefully in her trembling hands. “This is the worst day of my life.”

Mary Jane chuckled softly, still staring out the window. “Well, at least now you know you’re a better aim than you thought.”

April groaned as her bladder churned within her. “I seriously need to go still.”

Glancing over at the full cup in April’s hands, Mary Jane sighed. “You know, you could just pour it out the window and go again. I mean, it’s raining hard enough that no one would even notice.”

April’s face scrunched up in embarrassment. “I’m not going to do that, Mom! What if someone sees?”

“April, no one’s moving! Everyone’s probably as miserable as we are right now. Just dump it out and get on with it. You said you still need to go, right?”

“I’m not pouring pee out the window, Mom!” April snapped, squirming in her seat again, still clutching the cup. “Why do you always have to make things more embarrassing?”

Mary Jane tried to suppress a grin, leaning her elbow on the window. “Alright, fine. But you’re going to have to figure something out, and I don’t see any other options.”

April groaned, her face red as she sat there, now pantsless in the passenger seat. The pressure in her bladder was still immense, and the cup taunted her with how little relief it had provided. “Just… talk. Tell me the rest of the Amsterdam story so I can think.”

“Are you sure you want to hear it?” Mary Jane said with a smirk, turning back toward the windshield. “You might not, because it’s actually my third pee accident story.”

April’s jaw dropped, her voice rising in frustration. “Mom! Why is everything about you peeing your pants today? Seriously?”

Mary Jane shrugged, trying to keep a straight face. “Hey, it’s been on my mind with all the talk of bathrooms, accidents, and everything. Plus, Amsterdam was… well, it was a very memorable trip. Maybe it’s fate that we’re stuck in traffic together, reliving my greatest moments.”

April shook her head, exasperated. “You’ve got to be kidding me. I don’t know why I keep asking you for stories.”

“Because deep down, you’re intrigued.” Mary Jane grinned, her tone light. “Admit it—you want to know what happened.”

April let out a reluctant groan, biting her lip. “Fine, whatever. But please just continue the story before I lose my mind.”

Mary Jane smiled, picking up where she’d left off. “Alright, so where was I? Oh yeah—so my friends and I were at this café, and they convinced me to try marijuana for the first time. I’d never smoked before, so I was a little nervous, but they kept saying, ‘When in Amsterdam, right?’ So, we got this little joint and sat down at a table outside, right along the canal. The night was warm, and we lit up.”

April, still shifting in discomfort, listened despite herself, momentarily distracted by the story. She had smoked weed many times herself, but had never imagined her stuffy rule following mother had. “And? How was it?”

“At first, it didn’t feel like much,” Mary Jane said, her voice growing softer as she reminisced. “But then it hit me, and it hit me hard. It was like this warm, fuzzy feeling washed over me. Everything felt slower and more… intense. We just sat there, staring at the boats going by, and time sort of slipped away. We ended up sitting there for two hours, just giggling and talking. It was like every little thing we said was the funniest thing in the world.”

April’s curiosity was piqued now, despite her frustration. “Who were you with?”

“Two of my friends from college—Leslie and Beth. Leslie was this tall redhead, super talkative, always had a million things to say. She was in my sorority. Beth was more quiet, but she had this wicked sense of humor. The three of us were sitting there, passing the joint between us, talking about everything and nothing. And of course, at some point, I started feeling the urge to pee.”

April rolled her eyes. “Of course.”

Mary Jane laughed. “Yeah, it’s like a theme with me, I guess. But this was different—because I was sohigh. I felt the pressure building, but I couldn’t quite make myself care enough to do anything about it. I just kept sitting there, enjoying the conversation and the warm, fuzzy feeling.”

April raised an eyebrow, a hint of a smile tugging at her lips. “And what were you all talking about?”

Mary Jane chuckled. “Well, Leslie was going on about how she wanted to open a cat café back home, where people could sip coffee and play with rescue cats. Beth was teasing her, saying that no one would ever take it seriously, and then Leslie got all mock-offended and tried to explain how it was a business opportunity. Meanwhile, I was just sitting there, feeling like the whole world was the softest pillow. But my bladder was getting worse, and I knew I needed to do something about it.”

April squirmed, leaning her head back against the seat. “So did you?”

Mary Jane grinned sheepishly. “Eventually, yeah. But not before I had this moment where I realized just how bad I had to go, and it hit me all at once. You know that feeling when you’ve waited too long, and your body’s like, ‘Okay, time’s up’?”

April nodded, still holding the cup nervously. “Yeah, I know that feeling very well right now.”

Mary Jane smiled, continuing, “Well, that’s what happened to me in Amsterdam. I had to scramble to get up from the table and find a bathroom, but of course, we were outside by the canal, and the café was packed.”

Mary Jane chuckled as she recalled the incident. “So, we’re standing there by the canal, and I’m feeling the pressure building. Leslie and Beth look at me and realize I’m about to burst. ‘Come on, we need to find a bathroom,’ Leslie says, taking my arm. I’m nodding along, trying to keep it together, but every step makes it worse.”

April interjected, rolling her eyes. “And you didn’t just, like, find a bathroom sooner?”

Mary Jane waved her hand dismissively. “Oh, we were having fun, you know? But then Beth pipes up with her usual nonsense. She’s all, ‘This is why I wear diapers to raves.’ Can you believe that?”

April laughed incredulously. “Diapers? Seriously?”

Mary Jane grinned. “I know! I shot her a look, half-amused and half-annoyed. I mean, who wants to deal with that? But she kept going on about how it’s freeing. ‘I can just let loose and not worry about finding a bathroom!’”

“Sounds like Auntie Beth,” April said, shaking her head. “But that’s so extreme!”

“Right? So anyway, we’re walking along, and I’m doing this little pee dance, shifting from foot to foot. ‘Guys, can we hurry up? I really need to go,’ I say, and they finally take me to a more secluded spot by the water.”

April raised an eyebrow. “And you actually thought about hovering over the canal?”

Mary Jane nodded, laughing. “They convinced me! Leslie said, ‘It’s better than peeing your pants!’ I was like, ‘Okay, fine.’ So, I lowered my baggy jeans, and you know how that goes. My bush was on display and I hadn’t cleaned it up in awhile because I’d been backpacking for so long. Leslie caught a glimpse of my lips and I was really self-conscious, but I figured it was better than nothing.”

April grimaced. “I can’t believe you were actually doing that! What happened next?”

“Just as I was about to let go, we hear this loud voice. ‘Hey! What do you think you’re doing?’ It’s a couple of cops!” Mary Jane exclaimed, her eyes wide as she remembered the panic.

April gasped. “Oh my god, what did you do?”

“I froze!” Mary Jane said, laughter bubbling up. “I’m caught in this awkward position, trying to explain. The officers weren’t having it. They started giving us a stern talking-to about public decency.”

“And you just stood there with your pants down?” April teased, giggling.

Mary Jane laughed, shaking her head. “Pretty much! I was mortified. I even thought about how much I could let out in my pants without anyone noticing. But after a stern warning, they let us off with just that, saying to stay safe in Amsterdam.”

April shook her head, laughing incredulously. “Wow, that sounds like a disaster! But also kind of hilarious in hindsight.”

Mary Jane glanced over at April, who was still squirming in her seat. “So after the cops let us off, we kept stumbling down the canal, high as kites, and desperate to find a bathroom. But every bar or club we passed either had a line, or the bouncers just turned us away the second we tried to get in.”

April groaned. “I can’t believe you didn’t just find a bathroom earlier. Why does it always seem like you’re in these situations?”

Mary Jane laughed. “Trust me, I was thinking the same thing at the time! But, you know, the weed had my brain in a fog, and I was feeling so relaxed… except for the whole about-to-explode thing. Leslie and Beth were laughing, but they weren’t as desperate as I was. And every bouncer we talked to just gave us the once-over and told us to keep moving.”

April raised an eyebrow. “No sympathy for three girls on the verge of disaster, huh?”

“None,” Mary Jane sighed dramatically. “At one point, we passed a club, and I thought maybe we could sweet-talk our way in. But the guy at the door just shook his head. I remember thinking, ‘What if I just… let it happen?’ I was that desperate.”

April cringed. “Mom, seriously? You were thinking about peeing yourself?”

“Hey, don’t judge!” Mary Jane replied with a laugh. “I was so high, and the thought crossed my mind—like, maybe it wouldn’t be that bad. The warmth, the relief… In my head, I was weighing the pros and cons, and honestly, the pros were winning.”

April grimaced. “You’re killing me.”

“Oh, come on. You know that moment when you’re absolutely bursting, and you think to yourself, ‘Just a little bit wouldn’t hurt, right?’”

April rolled her eyes, but a small smirk played on her lips. “I can’t believe you actually thought about it.”

Mary Jane shrugged. “I was in full-on desperation mode. Every step was making it worse, and my bladder was sending me these very persuasive signals. ‘Just do it, it’ll feel so good,’ my brain kept saying.”

April shook her head, her cheeks pink. “That’s so gross!”

Mary Jane chuckled again. “I know, I know. But when you’re high and bursting to pee, your mind goes to some weird places. I was basically daydreaming about how amazing it would feel to just… let go.”

April crossed her arms, looking both horrified and amused. “Did you actually consider it?”

“I mean, I thought about it for a second,” Mary Jane admitted with a grin. “But I knew I’d regret it if I did. Plus, Leslie and Beth would never let me live it down. They were already making fun of how desperate I was. I didn’t need to give them more material.”

April shook her head, laughing despite herself. “Unbelievable.“

Mary Jane sighed, a mixture of amusement and embarrassment in her voice as she continued. “So, after what felt like hours of wandering around, we came across this… well, this peep show. It had this neon sign flashing outside, and honestly, it wasn’t the kind of place we were planning to go to. But at that point, I was ready to do anything—anything—just to find a bathroom.”

April’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Wait… a peep show? Mom, no. You didn’t.”

“Oh, we did,” Mary Jane said, giving her daughter a sheepish grin. “Leslie spotted it first and was like, ‘Let’s try there! No one’s going to care about us using the bathroom in a place like that.’ And desperate times, you know… I was in no state to argue.”

April groaned and shifted in her seat, her discomfort mirroring her growing embarrassment over the story. “Please tell me you didn’t actually go in.”

“Oh, we did,” Mary Jane admitted with a laugh. “And the bouncer at the door—big guy, kind of intimidating—he looks us up and down and says we can’t just use the bathroom. We had to pay for the show first. I mean, can you believe that?”

April was horrified. “You paid to watch a peep show just so you could pee?”

“At that point, I didn’t care!” Mary Jane threw her hands up. “I was absolutely bursting, April. I would’ve paid double if it meant getting to a toilet. So, we grudgingly paid the fee and followed the bouncer inside.”

April’s mouth dropped open. “You actually watched the show?”

“Well, yeah, kind of had to,” Mary Jane said with a nervous chuckle. “We’re standing there, waiting, and of course, they make us sit through it first. So we go in, and it’s this dimly lit room with a glass booth, and the show starts, and it’s… well, it was definitely not my usual cup of tea.”

April buried her face in her hands, groaning. “Oh my god, Mom. Why are you telling me this?”

Mary Jane shifted slightly in her seat, her face flushed with a mix of embarrassment and humor as she continued the story for April. The rain outside still tapped steadily against the car’s windshield, and the tense atmosphere inside had been softened just a little by the absurdity of what she was about to confess.

“So there we were,” she said, her voice quieter now, as if almost reliving the moment. “Leslie and Beth were standing next to me, and the show was going on, but I couldn’t focus on any of it. The music, the dim lights, all the strange things happening in front of me—it was all a blur. There was a naked heavyset woman touching herself up on the stage, but the only thing I could think about was my bladder. The pressure was overwhelming, and every time I shifted my weight, it felt like I was on the verge of losing control.”

April squirmed in her seat again, the second-hand embarrassment clearly written on her face. “I still can’t believe you stayed.”

Mary Jane gave her daughter a sheepish smile. “It was either that or run out of the room without any idea where I could go. The weed… it messes with your head. I kept telling myself I could hold on, that it would be fine. But in reality, every passing second was like torture. And the worst part was, because I was high, I was hyper-aware of everything—the way my muscles kept tensing and trembling, the heat spreading through my body as I tried to keep it together.”

April groaned, burying her face in her hands for a second before peeking through her fingers. “How bad was it?”

“I’m desperately doing this awkward pee dance in the corner. The whole room was filled with tension—my bladder was seconds away from giving up. And then… it happened.”

April peeked through her fingers, eyes wide. “Wait. You didn’t…?”

Mary Jane nodded, looking both embarrassed and amused. “Oh, I did. Right there, mid-show. My body couldn’t take it anymore, and I just… let go. I tried to stop it, but it was too late. The relief was unbelievable, but the timing? Mortifying.”

April gasped, equal parts horrified and fascinated. “You wet yourself? In a peep show?”

Mary Jane sighed. “Yeah, and right there, as I’m standing, the puddle just started forming at my feet. I thought I’d be able to hold it until we got to the bathroom, but nope, I lost it right then and there.”

Mary Jane let out a breath, leaning her head back as she recalled the moment. “It started slow—at first, just a little bit, like the dam was cracking. I could feel the warmth spreading between my legs, soaking into my jeans, and for a second I was so out of it, it didn’t even register. I just thought, ‘Oh, that feels… strangely nice,’ like my body was so desperate for relief that even those few seconds felt like a release of the unbearable pressure.”

April looked horrified, her mouth hanging open in disbelief. “Mom…!”

“But then,” Mary Jane continued, her face reddening again as she described the sensations, “it hit me all at once what was happening. The warmth wasn’t just a little anymore—it was spreading fast, soaking through my jeans, down my legs. The feeling was unreal. I was still high, so my brain couldn’t process whether to feel mortified or just relieved. It was like my mind was moving in slow motion, but my body… my body knew it was too late. The pee just kept coming, and I couldn’t stop it.”

April was practically squirming in her seat, half-mortified, half-fascinated. “So you…?”

“Completely,” Mary Jane admitted with a laugh, though her cheeks were a little pink from the memory. “It was like a flood. My jeans were soaked through, and the puddle on the floor was spreading, too. I felt it dripping down into my shoes, and I swear, my whole body just sagged with relief. I didn’t even care about the show, or where I was. In that moment, the relief was everything.”

April shook her head, still not sure whether to laugh or cry. “And Leslie and Beth?”

“Oh, they noticed. They both turned to me, wide-eyed, and Leslie muttered something like, ‘Oh my god, you’re peeing!’ Beth just stood there, not even bothering to help me or anything. But after a second, they both burst out laughing. I was still half in my own world, feeling everything—the relief, the embarrassment, the heat in my face and down my legs. I was so out of it, I didn’t even care what the bouncer might think.”

April grimaced. “I can’t believe you survived that.”

Mary Jane shrugged, a smirk tugging at her lips. “I barely did. But in the moment, it was like nothing else mattered but finally letting go. Of course, once the show ended and I had to leave the room in soaked jeans, it hit me how embarrassing the whole thing really was.”

April leaned back in her seat, her face red from both the story and her own growing discomfort. “That’s… that’s honestly worse than I thought it would be.”

“Hey, at least I was with friends,” Mary Jane said with a wink. “It could’ve been worse.”

April cringed, but she couldn’t help but laugh a little at the absurdity of it all. “That’s so… I don’t even know what to say. You actually peed yourself inside the show?”

“Trust me, I was just as horrified in the moment,” Mary Jane said with a sheepish smile. “But the worst part? We still had to go up to the bathroom afterward, and the bouncer gave us this look, like he knew exactly what had happened. I’ve never been so relieved and mortified at the same time.”

April sat back in her seat, shaking her head, a smile slowly creeping onto her face. “Well, at least I know now why you’re so weird about bathrooms.”

Mary Jane shrugged, trying not to laugh. “What can I say? Some things never change.”

April stared down at the cup in her hands, feeling both exasperated and slightly amused. “Okay, fine. But I’m still not dumping this out the window.”

“Sweetie, emptying a portion of your bladder never ends well. It will come back to bite you,” Mary Jane chided. “Haven’t I ever told you the story about my job interview when I was 24?”

April sighed.
