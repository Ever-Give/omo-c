I'm shipping Sarah and Carrie 😁

I also hope further in the story there's some deliberate wettings 👌

Great story so far

Haha, I guess we'll have to see if Carrie can come to terms with her feelings first! Thank you though, I appreciate the support.

As for deliberate wettings, only time will tell.

Hi everyone. This story follows two of Sarah, Ronnie and Jules' other housemates, Carmen and Laura, and contains both wetting and messing. Be warned. Pretty early on, it splits off into two perspectives. Avoid the Carmen perspective to avoid the messing content.

As this is a bit of a longer chapter, this will be the last one that I post before Halloween. I am currently drafting the Halloween to Christmas arcs and would love some suggestion on the direction you want the story to take or scenarios you want specific characters in.

However, without further ado, I am happy to present:

Chapter 5: The Out of Control Rager

Carmen was already tipsy from the pre. Even though the party was going to be held at her own house on Sherbrooke Avenue, the gorgeous Hispanic brunette had opted to meet up with her friends from her dance studio to get ready together and have a few drinks before heading over. Aside from Laura, the brunette soccer player who had been her first year roommate, Carmen did not particularly like her housemates. She found Erika and Jules to be too nerdy and school focused, while Sarah was a loose cannon and a party animal. The three of them were all immature in Carmen’s eyes and she felt like they were not as classy and sophisticated as her.

Despite her annoyance with her housemates, worst of all in Carmen’s eyes was Ronnie, the statuesque blonde who towered over many men. Carmen was used to being the hottest person she knew, and while Jules was definitely pretty in her own right, Carmen knew that the only housemate she couldn’t compete with for looks was Ronnie. This frustrated her to no end, and she found herself resenting Ronnie more and more for the attention she drew from everyone that saw her.

While most of the dance team had opted to Uber to the party from the pre, Laura had insisted that she and Carmen walk so that they could try to bump into some cute boys to invite to the party. Now the two of them were walking down Hutchinson Way, past bars and restaurants, with Carmen’s closest dance friend Maddy in tow. Maddy was in the Business Program like Jules, Ronnie and Sarah, and she was also so smart that she was a TA. Carmen liked her sarcastic demeanour and brash confidence that set her apart from many timid people. True to her personality, Maddy was dressed in a very short black miniskirt that barely covered her panties and a white crop top that showed off her boobs. Her curly brown hair was bouncing all around her.

Carmen was dressed to slay. In her sheer strapless red dress that fell just below her ass, and her tall black boots that rose to mid thigh, men on the patios were drawn to stare at her. She was basking in their gaze and enjoying every minute of their attention.

“Ew, remind me to make a quick donation in your ensuite when we get back, Laura,” Carmen said, noting the rising pressure in her bowels from the smoothie she had had for dinner.

Laura laughed and agreed. Carmen had taken to calling her shits donations since she found the others terms to be distasteful and obscene. Feeling a slight tingling from her bladder, Laura realized that she should also use the bathroom when they got to their house. The shots she had taken at the pre had gone right through her and her tiny bladder meant she already needed to go.

In contrast to Carmen and Maddy, Laura was dressed much less provocatively. The brunette had her hair tied back in a ponytail, was not wearing any makeup and was just wearing blue jeans and a grey sweater with no bra underneath. She felt plain in comparison to her two friends but she was also determined to meet a cute guy that night. She did not want to graduate from university without first dating someone!

As the three friends approached the intersection of Hutchinson and Sherbrooke, they spotted a large group of guys, clearly intoxicated, tossing around a football and whooping in excitement. When the guys saw the girls, they all began cat calling them in appreciation. Carmen, enjoying the attention, yelled back that they were going to a party and gave them the address of 54 Sherbrooke in hopes that they might all show up. Laura was excited by the prospect of so many attractive guys showing up. She knew she would be able to hit it off with one of them.

Five minutes later, the girls found themselves on the porch of 54 Sherbrooke. Music was pounding from inside and Laura could tell that Mo Bamba by Sheck Wes was blasting from a speaker. When the door swung open, the girls were greeted by the sight of nearly 50 drunk university students already well into their partying. There was a group of guys playing beer pong around a folding table in the kitchen, while a group of 20 people led by Ronnie were sitting around the coffee table in the living room playing King’s Cup.

Carmen spotted Jules in the corner of the kitchen talking to a blonde first year girl and watching the pong game. Sarah was sitting on the kitchen counter, beer in hand, cheering on her crush Jackson who was playing pong with their other friend William. Carrie was sitting next to her, downing a bottle of straight vodka. Timid Erika was awkwardly sitting on the stairs with some of her engineering friends, a white claw cooler open in her hand. Carmen was shocked to see her drinking. Seeing the utter chaos made her realize that maybe this party wouldn’t be so lame after all.

“Why did you guys invite kids that I literally TA,” Maddy asked, gesturing to the girl in the corner of the kitchen talking to Jules.

“I don’t know half of these people. It’s mostly your program, Maddy,” Carmen replied with a shrug. “I’m just excited that apparently the boys’ hockey team might be coming!”

“Yeah, the captain is hopelessly in love with Ronnie,” Laura said, causing Carmen to roll her eyes.

“I don’t understand why everyone is obsessed with her,” Carmen said exasperated.

“She’s so hot!” Laura exclaimed, making sure to quickly add “But not as hot as you bebs!”

Carmen shrugged her shoulders, marched into the kitchen with her long black boots on, and poured herself a cup from the large bowl of jungle juice on the counter. Laura and Maddy followed suit. As soon as Jules and the blonde first year saw them, they darted away, up the stairs. The three girls took their spot and began drinking the jungle juice and flirting with the boys playing pong.

———

Two hours later, Carmen found herself in the garage getting hot and heavy with the hockey team captain, Josh Patterson. She had taken it very personally that he was into Ronnie, and had hit on him all night, through games of pong and flip cup. Finally, grabbing her by the hand, he had led her out the back door, across the lawn and into the garage. Pushing Carmen backwards onto the hood of Erika’s green Volkswagen Beetle and hiking up her red dress so that her black lace panties were exposed to the light, Josh began kissing her passionately, running his hands over her supple breasts.

Carmen moaned in pleasure and kissed him back. However, there was one slight issue with this otherwise perfect moment. Carmen had yet to make her “donation”. The alcohol had lowered her ability to maintain her composure and now the urge to defecate was overpowering her, her asshole dilating as a log began to prairie dog out of her.

Carmen knew she was in trouble but she simply wanted to fuck this boy so badly. Sliding her black panties aside, she unbuttoned his jeans, slid them down and slipped his dick into her. He began to thrust into her, and she leaned back on the hood as he leaned in and slid her dress down to suckle her brown nipples.

Moaning Josh’s name in ecstasy, Carmen could feel her control over her body weakening. Somehow, Josh’s thrusts were reverberating through her abdomen and paining her bowels. The tip of her poop kept emerging from her anus, before disappearing back in with every thrust. She was straining to hold it, but in her euphoria and drunken state, the pleasure was too much for her to want to stop.

After a few minutes, Josh rolled Carmen over onto her stomach on the hood and began thrusting into her pussy from behind. This new angle was difficult for Carmen to control herself as she lay spread eagled on the green hood of the Beetle. She felt the log begin to slide out in earnest until finally she knew the tip was exposed to the world, where she finally regained control.

Looking down at the slightly protruding poop, Josh struggled to comprehend what he was seeing in his drunk state. “Are you shitting?” he blurted out.

“Noooo,” moaned Carmen. “It’s just… ah! A butt plug!”

Satisfied with this answer, Josh went back to thrusting.

———

Meanwhile, back inside, Laura was seething. Maddy had screwed her over so hard. During a game of truth or dare, Laura had been chatting with a cute Asian guy from the hockey team named Ethan. Maddy had seen it unfolding and when she was dared to handcuff herself to someone, she had chosen Laura as her partner. Now there was no chance that Laura could get Ethan alone, since she didn’t know where the key was. She was stuck with Maddy for the rest of the night, and she still had to pee so badly.

Now the two girls were playing beer pong against Ethan and his friend Omar. Since her dominant hand was cuffed to Maddy, Laura was severely struggling to hit shots. The boys only had two cups left to hit and the girls had yet to hit a single cup. Laura was fuming, since she was used to being the best person in her friend group at beer pong. She refused the idea that she and Maddy wouldn’t hit a single cup and would be forced to serve the requisite punishment; running a naked mile to the end of the street and back.

Maddy tossed a ball across the table and it hit the rim of the back right cup, careening into the corner of the kitchen. Steeling herself and trying to focus, Laura tried to line up her shot with her left hand. Her bladder was pounding to be released, and she bounced lightly on her left leg. It was so hard to focus, but she drew her arm back and released a shot. The ball flew clean over the end of the table, and hit the counter behind.

“Gosh you suck tonight,” Maddy said in a condescending tone. “Try to stand still next time you shoot.”

“It’s not my fault I can’t shoot with my bad hand,” Laura responded defensively. “And I just kind of need to pee. Can we take a break after this game?”

“Ew, I don’t want to see you pee,” Maddy said, making a face. “Just wait until we get the key back. I’m sure Jackson has it somewhere.”

Jackson did in fact have the key, but at the moment as she glanced around the main floor, Laura couldn’t see him anywhere. There were a ton of people dancing in the living room and Carrie was making out with a cute black guy, but Sarah was nowhere to be seen either. Laura grimaced, wondering if perhaps Sarah had finally gotten her wish and was getting fucked by Jackson. Laura knew that if she was, it didn’t bode well for her bladder.

“Ready to get naked miled, ladies?” Ethan asked flirtatiously, cutting through Laura’s thoughts.

“Absolutely not,” Maddy said, using her free right hand to raise her shirt, revealing her voluptuous boobs in their black lace bra.

Distracted by the sight, both Ethan and Omar missed their shots. Returning fire, both girls missed again. Suddenly, Laura was hit by another wave of desperation and she quickly crossed her legs as she felt a jet of pee hit her panties. She needed the game to end fast.

“Come on, it’s your turn to distract them,” Maddy said, grabbing the hem of Laura’s grey sweater and raising it to her chin.

Laura squealed as her small perky tits were exposed to the ogling eyes of the boys across the table. Maddy, surprised by Laura’s lack of a bra, let go of the sweater, letting it fall back into place. However, the distraction was successful and both shots from the boys air balled. The surprise of the sudden exposure caused Laura’s bladder to contract in surprise, jetting into her panties for 5 seconds, and leaving a long dark streak down her inner thigh and causing her to pretzel her legs together.

“Maddy, I need to pee right now!” Laura announced in fear for what was to come.

——

Back in the garage, Carmen was struggling to keep her first log contained as she lay across the hood getting railed from behind. She knew if she didn’t do something soon, the log was going to fall out, directly onto Josh’s dick. Pulling away from him so his dick slipped out of her pussy, Carmen exclaimed in a panicked voice, “I just need to take out my butt plug, babe!”

Racing away from Josh, the Hispanic girl ducked behind the car, hiked up her red dress and pulled her black panties to the side. Before she had even squatted, the first log slipped out of her ass and fell between her black boots on the concrete floor in the shape of a crescent. Forcing herself to stop, Carmen began to panic. She needed to relieve the rest of her load soon without Josh noticing. She needed to get him to finish quickly so that she could slip back inside and finish her "donation". Her drunk mind wanted to ensure he only had good memories of this encounter, so she quickly circled back around and lay on her stomach on the hood of the car again.

“Get in there, sexy,” she told him seductively.

Josh, misunderstanding her command and thinking it related to the alleged butt plug removal, took the opportunity and plunged his penis into Carmen’s waiting butthole. Carmen gasped in shock, not ready for her butt muscles to be forcibly relaxed.

“Oh wow, you’re so tight,” Josh moaned as he began to thrust faster.

Carmen could feel her control slipping, as the tip of his penis repeatedly touched her waiting load. She started to feel it sliding out and she panicked. There was no way she was going to shit on the hockey team’s captain’s dick. She would never live it down.

“STOP,” she cried out, pulling away from him, so that his dick slipped out of her asshole.

She quickly fixed her panties and dress, threw open the garage door and bolted across the backyard. She could feel the poop erupting out of her, and the log was starting to tent out her black panties under her dress. She threw open the back door, shoved through two guys and charged up the back stairs. The line of people outside the communal second floor bathroom was at least 8 people long, and Carmen could hear someone puking inside. As she felt a log break off and settle into her panties, she knew she would have to use either Ronnie or Laura’s ensuite bathroom. Ronnie’s room was closest and Carmen quickly barged in.

“What are you doing?!” Ronnie cried out from her bed, where the tall blonde was lying wearing nothing but baby blue lace panties. Her hair was a mess and her large boobs were on display, completely exposed, implying that she had just had sex. Confusingly, in her arms was Sarah, fully clothed, her eyes red and her chest heaving with sobs.

“Need… toilet…” Carmen groaned, but it was too late.

With a loud fart sound, Carmen’s bowels erupted. Poop shot out into her lace panties like hot lava, filling them to capacity, before maneuvering out the leg holes and sliding onto Ronnie’s carpet. Try as she might, the Hispanic girl could not make it stop. Ronnie was staring at her in shock, as more noises emanated from her panties and she just continued to poop.

“Oh my god, Carmen, are you okay?” Ronnie asked in concern, but Carmen was already sobbing.

She slid to the floor of Ronnie’s room and her mess squelched as her ass hit the carpet. Leaving Sarah in her bed, Ronnie leapt up and guided Carmen into the ensuite. She eased down the black lace panties and dumped the brown mess contained within into the toilet. Then, she lifted Carmen’s arms over her head and peeled off the red dress. Unbuttoning her bra, she took that off too, then bent over to unzip the long black boots. Ronnie tossed all the clothing in the corner of the bathroom, except for the underwear which she placed in the sink. Then, she carefully maneuvered Carmen into the shower. Carmen, still in shock, stood perfectly still, letting the warm water wash over her.

Ronnie dropped her blue lace panties and stepped into the shower with Carmen. Taking a washcloth and a bar of soap, she began gently scrubbing the poop off of Carmen’s butt and legs, while saying soothing words to try and stop her crying.

“Why are you helping me?” Carmen asked between sobs. “We’re not even friends!”

“I may not know you that well, but we’re housemates. And housemates support each other,” Ronnie replied with a soft smile. “Besides, you’re the second sobbing person to enter my room in the last 30 minutes. Jackson just rejected Sarah. She could use a minute alone.”

“Veronica… Ronnie… Thank you. I owe you big time. I completely misjudged you as a person,” Carmen admitted to the bombshell. “I was jealous of you and never gave you a fair chance.”

“Don’t worry about it! I actually meant to ask for your advice but I was always too shy,” Ronnie admitted back. “You’re so confident! There’s this guy I really like, but I don’t know how to tell him.”

“Babe, you’re gorgeous! No way he rejects you. Is that why you were in here basically naked?” Carmen inquired, suspiciously. She really wanted to know who had caught Ronnie’s attention.

Ronnie laughed to herself and replied, “No, the guy I like isn’t here tonight. He doesn’t even think of me that way and this isn’t his scene. He thinks I’m too immature. I was actually trying to get over him tonight and I was going to hook up with some frat dude, but thankfully Sarah showed up crying before I did anything I’d regret. We only made out and undressed!”

The story was making Carmen begin to forget about her mishap. Her crying had reduced to a sniffle and she was starting to smile slightly. She pulled Ronnie into a big hug, the warm water pouring over their entangled bodies and whispered in her ear, “I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!”

——

Laura was entangled with Maddy in a very different way. Dying to pee, Laura had dragged Maddy upstairs to use her ensuite bathroom, crossing and uncrossing her legs as they went. Maddy was complaining the whole time, stating that she didn’t want to see Laura pee and that she probably hasn’t shaved. Laura hated that she was right. When they had reached the second floor landing, they had bumped into William again and the unthinkable happened. William kissed Maddy, and the two of them started making out with Laura still handcuffed to Maddy!

As the two of them started getting it on, Maddy was dragged behind them into her own bedroom, protesting loudly. She was writhing in desperation and jamming her non-cuffed hand into her crotch desperately. She could feel the warm wetness of the denim and knew that the quantity of pee that had already been released was bordering on an accident. William shoved Maddy backwards onto the bed, lifted her skirt past her waist and slid his hand into the waistband of her underwear. The jerky motion of the shove sent Laura tumbling backwards onto the bed.

“Maddy, stop, I don’t want to see this,” Laura pleaded. “I’m going to pee myself!”

Maddy paid her no heed and continued kissing William. He eased off her shirt and unclasped her bra, letting it fall onto Laura’s bed. Laura averted her eyes, not wanting to see the intimacy. Maddy was moaning loudly from William’s fingering and Laura was disgusted. Crossing her legs as she lay on the bed, Maddy reached down and unclasped her belt, relieving some pressure. She unbuttoned her jeans and attempted to shimmy them down her thighs.

Maddy noticed the movement and turned her head towards Laura. “Oh my god, do you wanna join?” she asked.

She then rolled over onto Laura, straddling the girl’s torso and pinning the girl’s hands to the bed. Heaving a sigh as William kept fingering her from behind, she began kissing Laura’s neck passionately.

“Maddy… oh! Stop!” Laura exclaimed through an involuntary moan. “I’m going to pee on you.”

Maddy grinned maliciously and gestured to the handcuffs. “Too bad you’re stuck with me!”

She then sat up, planting her ass directly on Laura’s bladder. Laura let out a gasp, as she strained every muscle in her body in a last ditch effort to hold back the flow and maintain her dignity. Smirking malevolently, her curly brown hair bouncing around her head, Maddy began to gyrate her hips, shifting her weight around on Laura’s poor bladder.

Laura could no longer prevent the inevitable. The shock of the additional pressure and the gyrating motion made her muscles finally give out. With a soft moan, her bladder gave out. She lay there, helplessly pinned below Maddy’s bodyweight, peering into the curly brunette’s bemused eyes as she utterly humiliated herself in her own bed.

The pee poured out of her into her underwear and slightly pulled down pants, pooling on her duvet beneath her. Laura didn’t cry, she just lay there in shock and let it happen. The relief was euphoric and she just wanted all her pee to get out of her as quickly as possible. Closing her eyes, she let the jet continue until it slowed to a trickle and finally stopped. The butt and crotch of her jeans were soaked through, as well as the back of her legs and up her back. She was laying in a large yellow puddle on her bed.

William was staring at her in shock, while Maddy was still giving her an amused look. A spike of anger went through Laura and she shot up from her bed, knocking Maddy backwards and spraying pee everywhere. Using her non cuffed hand, she delivered a brutal slap to Maddy’s cheek.

Maddy looked at Laura in disbelief and howled, “What the fuck was that for?!”

“Bitch, you made me piss myself when I told you a billion times that I had to pee! You literally started hooking up with this dumbass instead of letting me pee!” Laura screamed.

“I didn’t know it was urgent! I’m sorry,” Maddy said meekly.

“No you’re not! You enjoyed humiliating me,” Laura retorted. “I could see it in your eyes.”

“Uh ladies, let’s try to find Jackson and get the key,” William said, trying to diffuse the situation.

“When we do,” Laura said, venom oozing from the tone of her voice, “I want you out of my sight for the rest of tonight. We will discuss this tomorrow!”

This Halloween Special is being posted a few days earlier as I have a pretty busy weekend. It will introduce you to the last roommate at 54 Sherbrooke, Erika, the owner of the Volkswagen Beetle from the last chapter. This chapter contains no messing. Please let me know if you guys would like a character guide so the story is easier to follow.

Chapter 6: The Horrors of the Halloween Dance

Erika’s favourite holiday had always been Halloween. The shy ginger had been making her own costume every year since elementary school and she took great pleasure in the detail and effort that went into her elaborate designs. The O’Sullivan family was known throughout their neighbourhood for their elaborate pumpkin carvings and scary decorations. Erika loved every moment of Halloween, and she never felt like it was a holiday to be outgrown. In her first year of university, Erika had been nervous that she would be bullied by other students for going all out for Halloween.

This nervousness, coupled with the fact that Erika had opted to have a single room and therefore struggled to make friends, meant that Erika had almost opted to avoid Halloween altogether. Luckily, Erika had met Laura, her chemistry lab partner and she had convinced her that it was still cool to dress up. Instead of going out in slutty costumes, the two had dressed up as Sully and Mike from Monsters’ Inc and had won the costume contest at the nearby club, The Hairy Cougars. Every year since then, the two had dressed up in themed costumes and owned the night together. Unfortunately, this year things had changed.

Laura was unable to be there on Halloween night, as she was off playing an important playoff game for the University soccer team in Boston. Erika had been bummed, but she knew that it was for the best. With how well Laura had been playing recently, there was a serious chance that she would be noticed by scouts and finally get a chance to play for the American women’s national team!

Despite the fact that Erika wasn’t close at all with her other housemates, Veronica had been kind enough to invite Erika to join a group of people who were going to the Halloween costumed ball that was being held in Convocation Hall at the University. Ronnie had always been sweet to her, and Erika was grateful for the kind gesture from the tall blonde. Now Erika found herself in the kitchen of 54 Sherbrooke Avenue as she put the finishing touches on her elaborate costume.

Erika was dressed as a washing machine. She had a large box on over her shoulders, with holes on the side for her arms to extend out of, as well as the bottom for her legs. The box was painted white and there was a circular hole in the front filled with clear plastic. Behind the plastic, rotating around, were numerous articles of clothing; pants, shirts and even some underwear and socks. Erika had spent weeks rigging up the electronics that made the clothing rotate, and it made it extremely difficult for her to get out of her costume since all the wiring was on the inside. Nevertheless, she was thrilled to wear it, and she pulled on her white one piece swimsuit that went underneath, before putting on the costume herself.

“Wow, your costume is amazing,” Sarah, Erika’s brunette wasian roommate remarked. Dressed in a slutty playboy bunny outfit, Sarah’s costume did not leave much to the imagination.

“Yeah, you really overshadow me and Sarah,” Veronica joked, gesturing to her own slutty Hugh Hefner costume, complete with pipe, cap and robe.

“Thanks,” Erika replied, smiling.

Of her housemates, only Sarah and Ronnie would be joining that night since Jules wasn’t feeling great and was staying in bed, and Carmen was going to a frat party. Erika didn’t mind, since Carmen scared her with her intimidatingly forward behaviour and Jules didn’t seem to have much in common with her, from their few interactions. Jules always tried to engage with Erika but their conversations were always so formal.

Suddenly the doorbell rang, heralding the arrival of the remaining two people joining for the evening. The petite Italian brunette Carrie was let into the house, followed by the black and handsome Ben. Erika thought Carrie looked cuter than ever, dressed in her slutty angel outfit that showed off her cleavage. Ben was Veronica’s guy best friend from residence, a nerdy boy with glasses who didn’t go out much. He was dressed as Indiana Jones, with the fedora, brown leather jacket and whip. Both Ben and Carrie entered the house, giving hugs all around and stumbling a bit. They were both clearly well on their way to being intoxicated.

“Wow, Ronnie, you look horrible as Hugh Hefner,” Ben commented teasingly to Veronica, resulting in a hard punch on the arm.

“God I wish those two would hurry up and get a room,” Sarah whispered to Erika, rolling her eyes. “We all know she wants him, and she can have anyone she wants.”

Erika giggled and led the group back to the kitchen where she had mixed a large bowl of jungle juice, filled with all kinds of alcoholic beverages and juices. She poured everyone a glass and passed them out. The group then spent the next hour sitting around the large oak kitchen table, talking and teasing each other and playing drinking games. Erika’s bladder began filling up pretty quickly but she knew getting out of her outfit to pee would be a big hassle. She decided she’d wait until right before they all left to go, so she wouldn’t miss out on the fun.

“So…” Carrie said to Erika and Sarah, as Ronnie and Ben bickered about whose turn it was to drink, “when are we going to ditch the love birds.”

Sarah grinned at the thought. “Once we get to the venue, I vote we slip away. They probably won’t even notice, they distract each other so much! Besides, I’m in the mood to meet a cute boy.”

“You’re not trying to dance with Jackson?” Carrie asked, surprised.

“No, I’ve decided to play hard to get. He swerved my move at our house party even though we were together all night,” she bemoaned, rolling her eyes.

“What a dummy,” Erika commiserated. “But I’m sure you’ll make him jealous tonight, looking like that.”

Sarah blushed at the compliment, but Erika could tell it was boosting her ego. She returned the compliment to Erika and the conversation quickly shifted to their love lives. Erika could tell that Carrie was really eager to encourage Sarah to pursue people other than Jackson. Could Carrie have a crush on Jackson? Or could Carrie maybe have a crush on Sarah??

No way! Erika doubted that Carrie was interested in girls. Nevertheless, she felt herself get excited by the prospect. Erika had long been an introvert and sharing her own interest in people of the same gender was not something she was comfortable in. She had pretended to be interested in boys around most of her female friends, and only Laura knew Erika’s secret. She hadn’t even kissed a girl, and the thought made her nervous. Maybe she could try to pursue Carrie? Carrie was definitely someone Erika was comfortable talking to.

Suddenly Ronnie broke through Erika’s reverie with a loud announcement. “Guys, we need to catch the bus in 3 minutes or we’ll be late! The next one doesn’t come for half an hour!”

Quickly, everyone began scrambling to put on their shoes and rush out the door. As Erika shimmied her wide costume through the doorway and onto the porch, she realized she had forgotten to pee. The urge was nagging at the back of her mind and she knew she was gonna regret holding it. Ignoring it for the time being, Erika rushed down the steps and chased after her friends towards the bus stop.

——

15 minutes later, the 5 friends spilled out of the bus and onto the sidewalk in front of convocation hall. Hundreds of fellow students were milling about the entrance in costumes, waiting to be let in. Erika saw someone dressed as Drogon, the dragon from Game of Thrones, someone dressed as Gru and even a very realistic Chewbacca costume. Winning the costume contest would definitely be difficult this year.

“Looks like you guys aren’t the only slutty Hugh Hefner and Playboy Bunny,” Ben remarked to Ronnie and Sarah, earning him yet another jab from Ronnie.

“We’re not trying to be original, we’re trying to be hot,” Ronnie said with an eye roll.

“And we’re definitely succeeding,” Sarah added smirking, as a group of guys dressed as followers all stared as they passed. “Try not to get too jealous, Benjamin.”

Ben looked at her aghast. “What are you implying?” he enquired.

“Just make a m- hey!“ Sarah interrupted herself, after receiving a pointed kick and glare from Ronnie. “Oh get a room you two!”

Ronnie and Ben both flushed embarrassed and looked away from each other.

“Let’s line up and get inside,” Carrie piped up, to defuse the situation.

“Yes please!” Erika added, knowing she needed to get to a toilet soon. Her urge to pee was now impossible to ignore and she had begun shifting on the spot. She normally liked to cross her legs when she had to pee, but her costume unfortunately made this impossible.

The group quickly joined the queue and thirty minutes later they had made it into Convocation Hall.

“Can we run to the bathroom?” Erika asked.

“Let’s buy some drinks first, before everyone gets in,” Carrie suggested.

Everyone agreed, and Erika didn’t want to disappoint Carrie so she didn’t fight it. Instead, she happily joined the drinks line, gently marching on the spot.

——

An hour later, Erika was sitting at a table on the edge of the dance floor with Carrie and Sarah, shoes kicked off in a pile next to her. After the first drink from the bar, three more had followed in quick succession and the group of friends had found the drunk confidence to shred up the dance floor. Erika had ignored her desire to pee as it continued to build, until she could feel it sloshing around with every leap up and down. The fact that Carrie was paying her attention, coupled with the numerous compliments that her costume was receiving and the alcohol in her system made certain that Erika was in no rush to leave. She was remembering why Halloween was her favourite holiday. Eventually, a slow song had come on and Ben had finally asked Ronnie to dance. Sarah had grabbed Carrie and Erika by the arm and led them to the table where they were now seated, observing the dance floor.

“I can’t believe those idiots are finally figuring out they have feelings for each other!” Sarah said happily, her face red from the alcohol. “Ronnie has been in denial for at least a year.”

“And yet she’s never dated anyone else! She’s totally been waiting,” Carrie slurred drunkenly. “Would you guys wait that long?”

“I tried to wait for Jackson but I’ve almost given up,” Sarah admitted sadly.

“I always wait too long for things,” Erika admitted as she rocked in her chair, the alcohol in her bladder begging for release. She was too drunk to even notice the irony of her statement.

“Look, there he is!” Carrie exclaimed, pointing to a curly blonde boy dressed as Peter Pan near them on the dance floor.

Sure enough, it was Jackson and he was dancing with a girl with curly brown her, dressed as Slave Girl Leia in a gold bikini.

“Oh my god, he’s dancing with that bitch Maddy who made Jules’ mentee pee herself in a case comp!” Sarah exclaimed, jealousy oozing from her voice.

“She’s psycho,” Erika commiserated in her stupor, “She made Laura mess herself at our house party by hooking up with Will why they were handcuffed together.”

“That’s messed up,” Sarah said with a burp. “Also, I didn’t know Laura had joined the piddle pants club… I guess that means the whole house has joined except you and Ronnie, Erika.”

“So far…” Erika said with a giggle. Once she realized what she had said out loud, she blushed and then confessed, “I really need to pee, and this costume is a pain to get off.”

“I’ll help you,” Carrie offered. “I had problems getting my romper off after a concert in September so I know the pain of difficult clothing.”

Erika’s heart fluttered in her chest at the offer and she quickly accepted it. However, she was quickly interrupted.

“Oh my god, he’s kissing that bitch!” Sarah yelled distraught.

Erika’s head whipped around and sure enough, she was met by the sight of Jackson and Maddy absolutely snogging. Jackson’s hand was in Maddy’s curly brown hair and the other was feeling for her ass. Sarah immediately burst into tears and rushed from the room. Carrie and Erika leapt up after her and began pursuing. As they exited the dance hall and rounded the corner into the hallway, Carrie’s drunkenness caught up with her and she tripped, falling head over heels into a vase of flowers. Erika, in her cumbersome costume, stumbled into her downed friend and fell on top of her.

In the shock of the moment, Erika realized she had started to pee. She could feel her stream spraying past her lips and dampening the crotch of her white one piece beneath her costume. She gasped and managed to stem to flow.

Carrie on the other hand had started to cry from the startle of the fall. Erika realized they were way more drunk than she had realized.

“Are you okay?” Erika asked Carrie, concerned.

“I’m… fine!” Carrie gulped out between sniffles. “I just wish Sarah would get over Jackson.”

“Do you… do you have a crush on her?” Erika asked shyly.

“I think sooo,” wailed Carrie, tears streaming down her face, as her drunken self confessed her long denied feelings. “But I also think I’m drunk and being irrational!”

Erika pulled Carrie into a tight embrace, or as tight as was possible with her washing machine costume. Erika knew she was going to pee herself if she delayed much longer, with her moist lips and pulsing bladder at the forefront of her mind. However, she also wanted to see what would transpire if she stayed here with Carrie.

Leaning forward ever so slightly as she held Carrie’s gaze, Erika blurted out, “I understand. I like girls too.”

Carrie looked at her surprised, tears still streaming down her face. “You do? Oh my goodness, that’s a relief!“

Erika saw her opportunity and took it. Her drunk confidence got the better of her and she acted on pure emotion. She leaned all the way in and laid her lips on Carrie’s, eyes closed.

Carrie, taken by surprise, shoved Erika back.

“What are you doing??” the petite Italian asked. “Oh Erika, I’m so sorry! I meant it’s a relief because now I have a friend to discuss my feelings with! I don’t like you that way, I’m sorry. I don’t even think I like girls, just Sarah in particular. Other than that, I like guys.”

Erika was mortified. The ginger stumbled back in shock, apologizing profusely. The shock of the rejection made her whole body freeze up and before she could do anything to stop it, Erika realized she was peeing. A tapping sound filled the hallway as her stream began hitting the washing machine interior beneath her crotch.

“Oh no, are you peeing?” Carrie asked shocked.

Erika could only stand there nodding weakly. Then, she burst into laughter at her predicament. Pee jetted out of her pussy, into her costume. Because of the sealed nature of the costume, Erika knew it wasn’t visible. All the pee was pooling on the inside of the washing machine.

“I guess you turned on your wash cycle,” Carrie giggled, as the sound continued to emit from Erika’s crotch area.

Erika relaxed knowing no one would know about the accident other than Carrie. She let the pee blast out of her until it slowed to a trickle, gently sloshing around the base of her costume. She knew her white swimsuit was likely soaked through beneath her but she wasn’t too embarrassed. Instead, she kept laughing at the preposterous hilarity of the situation. Carrie was now laughing in earnest too and the two friends continued to chuckle in each other’s arms for a minute.

“I’m sorry for misreading the situation,” Erika said bashfully. “Please don’t tell anyone about it, or about this… accident.”

“Well I think we have to tell the Piddle Pants club,” Carrie said with a chuckle. “It’s almost becoming a bond in this friend group!”

Both girls started giggling again and then Erika piped up, “you know you can always come to me with advice about this Sarah thing right? I won’t tell anyone.”

“Thanks Erika,” Carrie responded. “I think it might be healthy to get it off my chest. I’ve been in denial for a bit.”

Still drunk and stumbling, the two friends rose to their feet and stumbled off down the hall towards the bathrooms to comfort Sarah. As they went, Erika felt the pee sloshing around inside her costume and couldn’t help but think about how having liquid in a washing machine was even more realistic. She was sure she would never forget this eventful Halloween.

Hello everyone! This chapter focuses on Laura. If you do not remember who she is, go reread Chapter 5! This story does contain messing, so be forewarned.

Chapter 7: The Soccer Finals

Laura’s stomach was beyond stressed on the bus ride to the championship soccer game. Glancing at her sleeping teammate Caroline beside her, she attempted to readjust into a more comfortable position in her seat. She had played in many important soccer games over her career, but none more important than this. After the team’s game in Boston on Halloween, Laura had been approached by two scouts from the American women’s soccer team. They had been blown away by her performance and the fact that she had scored an incredible bicycle kick goal in the dying minutes to send her school team to the finals.

They had agreed to come watch Laura play in the finals and consider her for the very team she had dreamed of playing for since she was six years old. Now, aged 21, Laura was about to play in the D1 soccer finals in Syracuse in front of an audience of over a hundred thousand people with her career on the line. Laura was understandably petrified. She wished her friends were there. Erika would quietly give her hand a squeeze to reassure her and Carmen would remind her that she’s a bad bitch. Thinking of her two best friends, Laura smiled to herself. She missed them, but she knew they wanted to see her succeed and would be watching on TV.

Laura had been beyond stressed for weeks. Her parents had been on her case since she had gone back to school to start applying to jobs for when she graduated, but Laura had yet to start to do so. She knew that by opting not to take an internship the past two summers in favour of completing soccer training camps, she had way less relevant work experience than other candidates. She knew that if soccer didn’t work out for her, she was going to be hard pressed to find a job that would take her. She needed to perform well for the scouts today.

“Ayo, Laura,” Naomi, Laura’s tall black teammate with long braided black hair called from the row behind. “You look like you’re about to shit yourself.”

“Shut up Naomi,” Laura said with an eye roll. “I’m just very nervous about how much this game means for me… for all of us! A bathroom would be nice though…”

“Yeah, I can smell the gas from back here,” Naomi said, waving her hand in front of her face and scrunching up her nose.

“Oh don’t be so dramatic, I’m not going to shit myself,” Laura said annoyed. “I’ve already had enough bathroom mishaps this year thanks to that bitch Maddy.”

Laura was still extremely pissed at Maddy after she had made her wet her pants at their house party. She had done the same to Jules’ mentee Victoria and had even stolen Sarah’s crush the week before, but somehow Carmen still insisted on being friends with her. Laura had been angry at Carmen for it but the stubborn Hispanic brunette had refused to back down, claiming Maddy was well intentioned. Laura was now pissed at Carmen too.

“Haha, I keep forgetting you pissed yourself at that party,” Naomi teased.

“Shut up, I don’t want the whole team to know,” Laura whispered angrily, as her butt emitted a silent fart.

“Don’t worry, I won’t. Besides, you know all my embarrassing secrets,” Naomi pointed out.

It was true! Laura had in fact walked in on Naomi touching herself in their shared hotel room at a tournament in Texas the year before. She had also witnessed her teammate piss in a water bottle in the back of a team bus. She and Naomi had grown extremely close over their 3 years together on the team, and they were now pretty close, even though they rarely hung out outside of soccer. In second year, when drunk at a team function, Naomi had eaten out Laura in a bathroom. This was Laura’s only lesbian experience and it had helped her realize she was very straight, but somehow she knew that Naomi had enjoyed it way more.

Nodding her head in agreement, she knew that she knew enough of Naomi’s secrets to trust her to keep hers in return.

“Just help me find a bathroom before the game,” Laura joked, “Or else we may have a code brown on our hands.”

“A what?” Laura’s seat mate Caroline asked, as she rubbed her eyes to awaken.

“Nothing!” Laura and Naomi squealed in unison.

Caroline smirked and scrunched up her nose. “Which one of you dumbasses needs to shit?”

Laura sheepishly raised her hand, causing the surrounding teammates to all start giggling. Laura smiled to herself and realized that the day would not be nearly as bad since she was surrounded by so many people who made her happy. Adjusting her butt in her seat so that it was clenched and we’ll supported by the cushion, Laura began to take her mind off her nervous bowels.

——-

Two hours later, the bus arrived in Syracuse at the stadium where the championship game was to be held. Peering out the window, Laura saw thousands of fans flocking to the gates to enter. Laura’s stomach turned at the sight, and a new wave of nerves washed over her. This was the largest crowd she had ever seen at one of her games. It was reminiscent even of times that she had gone to professional sport events, and that thought terrified her. She needed to be ready to perform in front of all these people, and in front of a TV audience too! Steeling herself, she grabbed her bag and dismounted the bus with her teammates.

Following Naomi along the side of the building, and through the doors, Laura found the team in the sights of the press. Cameras flashed and people shouted questions inquiring about the team’s strategy for the game. Keeping her head down, Laura shuffled past with her bags. Having her picture taken had always been something she disliked and the presence of the press did nothing to help alleviate her nerves.

Descending a staircase, the team found themselves in a long hallway in the basement of the stadium. They made their way to the dressing room and set all their stuff down. At long last, Laura could take the opportunity to have her pregame shit, a ritual that helped her calm down before each game. She never missed her chance to relieve herself of a load and relax a little before the game.

Just as Laura was making her way towards the bathroom, she heard Coach Margaret call her and the other striker Halle over. Putting off relief for a bit longer, Laura made her way over to where Coach Margaret was standing.

“Hey girls, there’s something I wanted to talk to about,” the silver haired coach said seriously. “I know this game is very crucial to your future careers and that you both want to impress the scouts who are here from the national team.”

Both girls nodded in unison, wondering where the coach was taking this conversation.

“I just need you to promise me that you won’t get selfish and that you’ll put the good of the team first. We all want to win today, so no showboating to impress anyone. Just stick to what you know.”

Laura rolled her eyes internally. Ever since they had been rookies, there had been a level of competition between Laura and Halle that stemmed from them both competing to be the best at their position. Last year, Halle had scored more goals than Laura but Laura had won the player of the year. This had led Halle to be even more competitive this year. They had bickered all season about who got to take spot kicks, who had to play on their off wing and even who got to wear what colour cleats. Today, of all days, Laura knew their rivalry would be more prominent than ever, but nevertheless she assured the coach that she would try her best to play a team game.

Halle nodded in agreement, her brown ponytail bobbing behind her. “We’ll support each other, don’t worry coach,” she said, while shooting Laura a competitive look.

Coach Margaret seemed pleased with this response and quickly moved into an explanation of how she wanted the two girls to work the attack in the game. As she broke down specific strategies she expected them to use to gain the upper hand, Laura shifted foot to foot to maintain control of her bowels. Her urge to pee was bothering her as well and she eagerly looked forward to getting a chance to visit a toilet when the conversation was over.

“… but you girls should probably get your gear on. Kick off is in 30 minutes and we need to get a warm up in,” Coach Margaret was saying as Laura snapped out of her reverie.

Laura groaned, realizing her bathroom trip would have to wait until after she suited up and Coach Margaret gave her pump up speech. Making her way back to her cubby, she stripped down into her black thong and sports bra, pulled on her long red socks that reached her knees, and shuffled around in her bag for her shorts and jersey. She pulled on the short white shorts that hugged her bum tightly and displayed her number on one thigh, then pulled her red jersey over her head. This was going to be her last time wearing her uni kit in a competitive game, and the thought made her sad. She had belonged to this team for 4 years and it had become like a second family to her. She was going to miss it dearly.

After she was ready and most of Laura’s teammates were putting on their headbands or fixing their laces, Coach Margaret made her way to the middle of the room and called for silence. She then proceeded to deliver a rousing speech about her pride for how far the team had come. She outlined the game strategy and emphasized that no matter what, she was proud of this unique group of girls. As she went on about how she wanted the offside trap to be played, the coach was interrupted by a few quick knocks at the door. An official peeked their head in and announced that it was time to make their way to the pitch for kick off.

Laura groaned inwardly, realizing she’d have to wait until half time to empty her bowels and bladder. As her team rose and the captain initiated a team cheer, Laura shuffled along clenching her butt cheeks and regretting her choices. Warm up would be a struggle, but she was sure that she’d be fine once the game started.

——

Laura almost let out a moan of happiness when the whistle blew after two minutes of added time, signifying the end of the first half of the game. Her body was desperate for relief and she couldn’t stand still as she shuffled from foot to foot while exiting the pitch. She knew she wasn’t playing as well as she could, as she had spent the vast majority of the 45 minutes in the first half distracted by her need for a bathroom. She knew there was no way that the scouts in the stands were impressed, as she had only had two shots from bad angles and one shitty cross into the box. Thankfully the game was still died nil-nil, but she knew that she needed to relieve herself during the fifteen minute break so she could perform better during the second half. Halle, in contrast, was playing great. She had blasted a shot off the post, nearly scored on a header and had many chances besides. Laura knew she was being overshadowed by her teammate’s performance.

As she shuffled towards the tunnel to the dressing room, Laura heard someone calling her name. Glancing to her right, she spotted an interviewer with a camera crew poised to ask her questions. Swarmed by cameras and bombarded by questions about her performance and the future of her career, Laura was overwhelmed. For a second, her nerves got the better of her and she felt a spurt of pee hit the black gusset of her panties. She quickly crossed her legs in a distinct way that caught everyone’s attention.

“Are you alright?” inquired the interviewer, giving her a weird look.

“I’m fine!” yelped Laura, her brown ponytail swinging behind her as she wriggled in desperation. “Just a bit nervous about the second half. I could really use a bit of time to recharge in the-“

“Oh don’t worry, we won’t keep you much longer,” the interviewer chuckled. “We just want to know how you’re planning to improve your performance in the remaining 45 minutes.”

Keeping her legs crossed, Laura began to bullshit an answer about hard work and tactics as she glanced over the shoulder of the interviewer at the scoreboard. There were seven minutes left in half time. In two minutes, Coach Margaret would make the team start heading back to the bench. Laura was not going to get a chance to relieve herself until after the game. Was she going to make it? She had begun to worry.

—-

With five minutes left in the game, Laura had stopped caring about how she played and only cared about not having a total accident on live TV in her white shorts. Every time she ran, small spurts of pee had soaked into the gusset of her panties. It now felt slick against her damp pubes and Laura did not enjoy the unpleasant sensation. Glancing down at her shorts, Laura thought she could see a loonie sized wet patch on the white fabric but it was hard to discretely get a good look at herself.

The game was going poorly. Naomi had fouled a player at the edge of the box with a spikes up tackle, earning herself a red card and being sent off. Now, in the dying minutes and down a player, fatigue was setting in. Laura knew things looked bleak for her team, and that they needed to hang on to the tie, survive extra time and force penalties for a chance to win. At the same time, she would have practically loved to score an own goal if it meant getting off the pitch faster.

Between her cheeks, a log kept prairie dogging in and out, and she was sure that there would be some residue on her black panties. Sweat was pouring down her face, and it was not only from the physical exertion of playing a 90 minute game. Suddenly a yell pierced her thoughts!

“Laura, get open!”

Ginger, the petite blonde midfielder had just managed to win a tackle and was running up the left hand side of the pitch with the ball. She sent a long through ball into open space beyond the other team’s defenders. The sudden turnover had caught them off guard and they were struggling to catch up to the kicked ball.

Realizing she had a chance of getting to the ball first, Laura’s instincts kicked in. Ignoring the harsh protests from her body, she took off towards the ball at full tilt, outpacing the defenders. Each step was agony, jostling her bladder and sending continual spurts into her panties and shorts. Laura ignored them, reaching the ball milliseconds before the defenders and knocking it ahead for herself to run onto. Off like a shot, she sprinted towards the goal with two defenders close at her heels. They were trying to keep up, but she was faster. In the back of her mind, Laura was aware that the spurts were turning into a steam but she did not care. The top of the box was in sight, all she had to do was enter, pick a corner and shoot. She had done it a million times, she could do it now. Fuelled by pure adrenaline, she careened into the box. Locking eyes with the keeper mid stride, she wound up her shot, aimed it and…

WHAM!

Laura’s face hit the grass and her body rag-dolled behind her. Stunned, Laura heard the referee’s whistle through ringing ears. What had happen? The shock of her fall was wearing off and Laura began to feel a peculiar warm sensation at her crotch as she lay on the ground.

“Am I bleeding from my crotch?” Laura wondered aloud.

Suddenly Halle was there beside her, offering her an arm and helping her up.

“Great play Laura,” the other striker whispered in her ear. “We desperately needed this penalty.”

The ref had called a penalty?! This was an opportunity that they couldn’t let slip away. Shaking her head to clear the shock, reality came crashing down on Laura. Glancing down at her legs, she saw rivulets of golden liquid snaking their way into her cleats and long socks.

“Halle… I’m having an accident,” she winced though the pain.

Halle’s eyes grew as wide as saucers as she examined Laura’s crotch, seeing the translucent white fabric revealing her wet black panties underneath. Quickly, Laura’s brunette nemesis shifted in front of her to shield her from the cameras and the eyes of fans.

The team captain of the other team was bickering with the ref, protesting the call, giving the girls some time to regroup.

“Oh my god, don’t worry! I have a weak bladder too! That was quite a fall you took, and after this much game I’m bursting too. It could have happened to any of us,” Halle said consolingly.

“I still really need to go number 2,” was all that Laura could whimper in response. “You need to take the penalty!”

“What?! Absolutely not! You deserve to take it, you won it. And besides, you’ve got the better pens record this year,” Halle exclaimed.

“I can’t… focus,” groaned desperately clenching her cheeks together in a last ditch effort to stop the eruption. Tears were welling in her eyes.

Halle looked at her, steely determination in her eyes and whispered angrily, “Laura, we’ve played together for 4 years now and we’ve never seen eye to eye. That being said, I’ve always admired your tenacity. You don’t take shit from anyone and you see everything through. Do not pick today, during the most important game of your life, to finally give up. You’re so close to your dreams!”

Laura knew her teammate was right. She had to do this, for her friends and family that believed in her, for her teammates that had been by her side through it all, but most of all for her 6 year old self that had dreamed of this moment. She knew what she had to do.

Lowering herself into a squatting position, Laura relaxed her body. Immediately, her bowels released their incredible load. A log tented out into her panties, then broke off as another one began to expand out. They were getting squished against her butt and a bulge began to form. As waste began to slip out the leg holes of her panties, her white shorts began to stain with brown.

Thankfully, Halle had beckoned over Ginger and two other midfielders, who stood in a protective circle around Laura as she messed herself. Laura thought quickly and spread her legs, using her hands to pull the leg holes of her white shorts away from her legs. This allowed her to gently shake a few of the logs out onto the grass, reducing the bulge. Not everything escaped, but enough to move naturally. Halle used her cleats to smush the logs into the grass and hide the evidence.

The referee made his way over to the girls, having given the other team’s captain a yellow card for the disrespectful nature of her arguing. Laura, having emptied herself completely, made her way to him and announced she’d be taking the penalty.

Handing her the ball, Laura made her way to the penalty spot. She placed the ball down, completely focused on scoring this penalty. She was so locked in that she wasn’t bothered by her translucent white shorts with brown stains that were being broadcast across the country. She wasn’t bothered by the feeling of warm poop between her buttcheeks. Instead, she was completely and totally in the moment.

The referee gave her a nod, and she backed away from the ball, ready to shoot. When he blew the whistle, Laura executed her stutter step run up, catching the keeper off guard, then expertly curved the ball into the bottom left corner. The keeper flopped helplessly in that direction, but the shot was so perfect that she couldn’t reach. It careened off the inside of the post and into the net. The crowd roared in admiration and Laura ran towards the corner before sliding on her knees towards the corner flag. Her team was all around her, mobbing her, hugging her, shouting her name.

Laura was crying tears of happiness and she felt someone grabbing her tighter than the others. She turned to see who it was and found herself staring into Halle’s large brown eyes that were also wet with tears, despite the fact that she was grinning.

“Nice shot, shitstain,” she said laughing, “I knew you could do it. We finally won a championship!”

Laura grinned. Maybe the two would become friends after all. Hopefully, if the scouts had liked what they saw, at Olympic training camp…
