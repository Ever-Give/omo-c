What it says on the tin! Dialogue I love in omo!

"Do you think you deserve a potty break?"

"Oh, come on! You can hold it!"

"You're not listening! I need to go now!"

"I need to go so bad.."

"It's not my fault! I wasn't allowed to go!"

"Maybe diapers were the right thing for you, clearly you're not as mature as you claim to be."

"There, there, just let it aaallllll out."

"I-I need a diaper change."

"I don't think I'm gonna make it.."

"Do you believe me now? I told you I needed to pee!"

"You better not ruin those new pants!"
