(this is just something I made)

"What a lovely day" said Skeppy. "I should go wake Bad up" the diamond boy went to Badboyhalo's room "morning my little muffin" Skeppy said petting Bad, "morning Skeppy!" Bad said. "can we go mining?"

"sure! We need more diamonds anyway" Skeppy said, "Okay let's go!" said the muffin,

They made it to the cave but then, "oh not now... " Bad said crossing his legs, Skeppy looked at him confused "are you Okay bad?"

"p-perfectly fine!" Bad said, he was scared to tell skeppy he needed to pee "okay then" they continued mining.

Then bad felt like he was gonna burst, he was still scared to tell Skeppy though. "Bad you really don't look fine... " Skeppy looked very concerned, "I-I'm fine Skeppy!" bad said, he couldn't hold it in anymore, he though he could make it but then

BOOM pee everywhere, Bad looked embarrassed and started crying "I... I'm so sorry Skeppy.." Skeppy hugged him, "It's okay Bad accidents happen"

"thanks Skeppy... " Bad said, they both went home then bad got changed, the end.
