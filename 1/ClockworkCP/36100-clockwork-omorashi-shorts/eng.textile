Clockwork was out in the woods wondering Around. She had forgotten to use the bathroom before leaving the Mansion. As she was walking one of her knives Fell out of her Pocket as she bent down to Pick it up she felt a Familiar Feeling in Her bladder. "Uh oh...I should have used the bathroom before I left.." Clockworks desperation only had gotten worst. She tried to distract her self by listening to Music but after 15 minutes she felt the pressure only getting worst. She was far from the Mansion. So she kept walking until she started Weeping a little as her bladder was begging for relief! She started to feel her Underwear getting wet a little.

"Oh no!!" She started to run witch was a BIG mistake. Her underwear now had a very noticeable wet spot on them. She couldn't pee in the woods because they was Slendermans Woods. That would be wrong. She finally stopped running and as she crouched Down and tried to relax but that only made the urge to Urinate worst. All of a sudden urine just shot out on too her pants and Underwear as she Started to cry. "n-No!!" It was unstoppable as she just gave up and started to let it all out with a sigh of relief. She finally stood up and tried to find her way back to the mansion crying.
