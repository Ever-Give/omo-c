A/N: This story will include sex/masturbation from BOTH SEXES!! At the top of each section I will include a warning if there is sex, and if it includes men in detail, and there will be ** next to the paragraph(s) that include it so it can be skipped if wanted.

ALSO this is completely fictional and a fantasy! Please don’t do this to real hotels, speaking as someone who works in one, our housekeepers don’t want to clean up after this!

I chew my lip as a nervous habit, and right now, it’s swollen. I signed up online, months ago, for a “special getaway” to a hotel in Florida that is hosting a VIP Event. I never thought I’d get chosen to attend, and once I saw that I was I immediately put down the deposit. It was a bit expensive, but that’s to be expected for an event of this nature. Heavy discretion, clean up, and set up. I close my suitcase full of sundresses, bathing suits, panties, and casual clothes and head to the airport.

The plane ride was mostly uneventful, though by the end I was feeling a need to pee. Not urgent at all, as it was only a three hour plane ride, but a nice, comfortable urge. I pulled my skirt down a bit as I stood and adjusted my white blouse, exiting the plane. As I waited for my luggage, I squeezed my legs together as my Arousal rose higher. I was finally going to get to indulge in my “interests” with other people, and maybe find someone I can share it with forever. How many people would attend? How much of the hotel can we use? My brain spun as I thought of all Possibilities, and between my legs got more and more wet by the second.

Te hotel was a forty five minute drive from the airport, and as I waited for my Uber my need got slightly more dire. I bounced my leg as I waited on the bench, enjoying the warm Florida air. I sipped on my Dr. pepper as I sat, hoping it would add to my urge.

Soon enough, my Uber arrived and I entered, greeting the driver and turning my attention to my phone. Part of the instructions were to let the hosts know we were driving there, so I let them know I was about 45 minutes out.

“What brings you to Florida?” My driver smiled at me in the mirror, a handsome man probably mid twenties. He had dark hair that matched his eyes, and a beard that brought out his white smile.

“I’m here for a special event with some.. friends.” Hopefully, we’d be friends by the end. If not more.

He nodded and smiled again, as you do in a customer service position. “Well, I hope you have fun. I will also be staying at this hotel for a while. Just finishing up my shift first.” Our eyes met in the rear view mirror again as my clit gained a heartbeat. It had been so long since I last felt the touch of a man on me, and to have the buildup of whatever wet activities we wanted beforehand…

”What made you want to come?” He asked and I bit my lip.

You. “Oh, god, everything.” I gushed, and felt this face heat up at how excitable I sounded. “I wanted to find people like me. And do it. Freely.”

His smirk killed me, and I added him to a mental list of people I needed to get to know more intimately before the trip was over. “Me too. I wanted to be able to just. Go fucking wild, yknow?”

Oh, I knew. I knew I wanted him, and I wanted to pee. Not in a toilet, but in his lap. I bit down on my lip and squeezed my thighs together again, both out of a rising desperation, and to her just any friction between my legs. I fantasized about my Uber driver, straddling him and having his hands all over me as we kissed. I’d grind myself into him, my pink tennis skirt falling just past my ass, pretty white panties with lace, feaux innocence. He’d suck on my neck and I’d moan, leaking into my panties barely enough to show a stain. Moving against each other, my legs unable to close, eventually I’d lose control and wet on his cock, my panties turning see through and his jeans darkening with my piss. I’d feel him harden underneath me even more as I wet us both, my skirt getting weighed down on the edges that my pee touched. When I finished, my warm pee having soaked us both, he’d slide my wet panties to the side and I’d ride him, his piss covered cock slamming into me. My wet skirt would slap against my ass as I bounced on him, releasing a little more as i always do minutes later onto us both. Eventually, he’d cum in me, creating another hot mess id love to have.

I swallowed, hard, trying to compose myself to answer. “Yeah. I get it.”

I wanted to talk to him more, but I also didn’t want to come off as too forward. I didn’t know how up front to be, or who would be okay with what, and as of right now, he’s still my uber driver. Hopefully later, he would be a hot fuck session, but for now I had to respect him and try to be professional.

“so, are you open to sex with the people here?”

Well, if he’s going to start the conversations, it would be rude not to answer. “Yes, are you?” God, I wanted him to say yes. My bladder was full now, I’d have used the bathroom twenty minutes ago if these were normal circumstances. But, they most definitely were not.

He nodded, eyeing me in the mirror. “I most definitely am. Hoping for it, actually.”

I could have came right there, between the anxiety-arousal surrounding being so desperate so far from a toilet, the anticipation of the events at the hotel, and the idea of fucking someone, ANYONE who longed for this like I did.

“How much farther?” I put a hand between my legs, pressing against my crotch. I did my best not to actively touch myself in this strangers car, but the bumps in the road and how horny and desperate i was made it difficult to deny the temptations. “I really have to pee.”

”oh honey that’s not even fair.” He half laughed at me, leaning back casually to drive with one hand. “I still have a few more hours before I get to see you do that, don’t tease me.”

”I can show you plenty later, I promise.” I couldn’t help but rub myself a little under my skirt. It did help a bit with the desperation, as well, which only worsened with each passing second. “But really, how close are we?”

He glanced down at his phone gps. “Five minutes. Think you can hold it?”

I laughed, which made me have to press down harder on my crotch. “Yes, I can, trust me. I’ve been much worse off before.”

”you can tell me about those times later, in my room.” He paused. “Your name is Abigail, correct? That’s who it said the Uber was for.”

”yes, and I’m sorry I don’t remember your name.”

”it’s alright. It’s Ethan, I’m sure you’ll be screaming it later, so it’s good to know.”

The Uber stopped before the hotel as he finished those promising words, and I almost didn’t have the strength to stand. “Promise?”

”id never lie to a pretty woman.”

And with that, I edited the Uber, and looked up at my accommodations for the next few weeks. A gorgeous glass building with green gardens, and a lovely overhang. I saw pools to either side, and knew there was a beach behind it. I entered the doors to a beautiful lobby as well, with marble floors and a waterfall in the center. Signs stating “Omorashi Festival” with pamphlets below were plentiful, along with “21+ signs. I approached the front desk where quickly, the young woman in a black dress asked for my name.

“Abigail Evans. For the festival.”

She smiled tightly as she typed into the computer. “Welcome, Miss Evans. May I see a ID please?”

I danced slightly as I bent down into my uggage for my wallet, my need now urgent. I found my drivers license quickly and handed it to her, trying to be discreet about my need. Then I realized, I don’t have to be here. I shoved a hand between my legs, waiting for my license back.

The girl looked at me, handing my my license and a small packet, along with a bigger one. “The small packet has keys and drink vouchers. The big packet is a consent form work rules, please fill it out and return it to me before participating. Would you like to know where the restrooms are?”

I grinned as I looked into her eyes, shaking my head. “No, thank you. I won’t be needing them.”

CHAPTER 2:

My room was on the sixth floor, room 626 B, which was connected to 626 A and 626 C via doors at each end of the room. The doors led to a shared common room with a beautiful purple sofa, a plain kitchen table, an island with marble topping, paired with a kitchenette. There was a TV facing the couch and a desk and desk chair in the corner, matching the one that was actually in my room. Huge floor-to-ceiling windows about 10 feet behind the couch overlooked the beach, with a set of glass doors that led out to the balcony. There was soft blue carpeting that stopped before the kitchenette, which had white and blue porcelain-esque tile.

My room was equipped with a large king bed with white sheets, blankets, and pillow cases. My mind wandered to how well any pee stains would stick out on such sheets. Also in the room, a small, outdated-looking green loveseat against the wall by a small window. We each had our own bathrooms with a shower/tub, toilet, sink, and mirror. I didn’t intend on using the toilet for much, but the access to privacy if I wanted it was nice. I could also lock my door from the inside, so my suitemates couldn’t get in without knocking.

The front desk attendant gave me a copy of the rules to keep after I signed off on them, and they now sat on the desk beside the green loveseat.

Rule 1: NO MESSING. This is a wetting-only festival.

Rule 2: NO entering someone’s room without prior consent.

Rule 3: NO peeing on/touching others without their consent

Rule 4: Gain consent of all viewing parties before engaging in sexual activity outside of one’s own room.

Rule 5: NO urinating in/spitting in food to be consumed by unconsenting parties.

Rule 6: NO SOCIAL MEDIA OR DISCUSSION OUTSIDE THESE WALLS. You have all signed a legally binding NDA, this is an exclusive event and we will press charges against those who violate the terms of the NDA.

Rule 7: You must be at least 21 years of age to participate in this year’s festival.

Rule 8: NO PARTICIPATING OUTSIDE HOTEL GROUNDS. Don’t subject other, nonconsenting individuals to your kink! This includes the beach outside our gates or in view of nonconsenting individuals, and the surrounding restaurants not on property. THEY WILL NOTIFY US OF BAD BEHAVIORS AND YOU WILL BE REPRIMANDED . This may include but is not limited to; being banned from Omofest, or any other events held by Jean and Jerry Hartfield, as well as the hotel and place of violation, fines, or legal penalties depending.

Rule 9: Have fun! New rules may be added at any time and guests may be asked to leave at the HOSTS DISCRETION WITHOUT A REFUND. Use common sense and decency.

The rules were all fairly common sense, however it wasn’t surprising the hosts felt the need to spell it out. You can never be too sure with a group of strangers.

Along with the rules, there was an opening ceremony to be held in the downstairs ballroom at 8 pm, mandatory. I sat now on my bed, legs bouncing and both hands shoved between them. I sat across from the mirror, conveniently opposite the bed, and smirked to myself. I knew I was attractive - a dancer’s body from nearly two decades of ballet, an ample bosom, long, strong legs, and strong-but-feminine facial features. My hair never stayed on colour for long, but for now it was a light ginger colour, cut to just above my shoulders in length. I had an okay tan, however, being from New England, I was still a bit pale from the winter months. I wore no makeup, except for mascara and a nude-red lip, trying to accent my natural beauty.

**I stood, admiring my body and how it contorted as I bent at the waist to better hold myself. Legs pretzeled, I straightened my torso and took myself in as I let go. Immediately, my crotch warms as a day’s worth of pee escapes me and floods my panties and skirt. I moan quietly at the relief as it pours down my legs, runs into my heels, and soaks into the carpet beneath my feet. I feel my pussy as pee gushed out of my and through my fingers, my clit throbbing hard. As I watched myself continue to empty my bladder into my panties and onto the floor, I began to touch myself, rubbing my clit slowly at first. My breath was shaky as I touched myself, the sensations being almost too much.

I wonder how many of the others are doing this right now, before the ceremony. I slipped my hand under the waistband on my skirt to feel the last drops of my pee escape me,and began touching myself again. Falling back onto the bed, I allowed a finger to enter me. It wasn’t long before I was gripping my nipple with my other hand through my shirt as I came, hard. My hips bucked up to meet my fingers, and I let out a few more moans before calming down. Laying there, spent and wet for multiple reasons, there was a knock at my door from the common room.

At first, I panicked, because my carpet had a noticeable puddle, my bed had a wet spot where I was laying, and my legs and skirt were damp as well. Then, I remembered why we were all here, and opened the door with a smile.

“Enjoying yourself already, it seems.” I tall, slender blonde eyed me, purring at me. “I can’t blame you. I did not too long ago, it was too hard to wait any longer.”

The idea of my suitemate hearing what I had believed to be quiet moans caused my cheeks to turn red, but I tried to recover quickly. “I-I agree. What’s your name?”

“A bit rude to ask without telling me yours first, but since you’re pretty I’ll let it slide.” She winked at me and leaned against the doorframe, her blue cocktail dress flowing gracefully with her subtle curves. “I’m Alexa. And you are?”

“Abigail.” I murmured, suddenly feeling underdressed and star struck by her effortless beauty and confidence.

Alexa reached out and cupped my face, which was honestly shocking, but somehow comforting. “Don’t be so shy, you look great like that. I hope to get to know you better soon, Abby. See you at the welcome ceremony.”

I watched Alexa walk away, her dress swaying ever so slightly with each step. I took everything in around me, and shut the door, turning back to the mess I’d made. One roommate down, one to go. I couldn’t help but wonder if my second suitemate would be a guy, or another girl, like Alexa and I. Or, if whoever they were, would be interested in women, like I was hoping Alexa to be.

This was going to be very, very interesting.

***

Soon enough, I found myself sitting in a metal chair in the ballroom, now in a pair of dry light blue jeans with tears at the knees, and the same white blouse with frills around the breasts.

At 8:05, a woman who appeared to be early-to-mid forties walked out with a man who seemed about the same age. The woman stepped onto a small box before the podium, and began speaking to us.

“Welcome, ladies and gentleman, to the Omorashi Festival of 2022, in Kissimmee, Florida! Jerry and myself, Jean, will once again be your hosts” She allowed for the lot of us to cheer for a moment before continuing. “This is the tenth anniversary of this festival, and my husband, Jerry, and I wanted to thank everyone who makes this possible every year. As I’m sure you know, organizing a discreet, safe event like this is no easy task, but you all make it worth it every year. Thank you all, especially returning festival goers, and sponsors!” Again, more cheering ensues before she continues.

I looked around the room, surrounded by at least 200 people, which was surprising despite the size of the hotel. I’d also never realized that this was an annual thing, I’d only heard of it semiu-recently on a site I frequented. Everyone looked happy, or desperate, or a mix of the two. Some looked up at Jean and Jerry, while others looked about the room curiously, like I did. I couldn’t blame them for their bewilderment, I’d never thought anything like this would have been possible, or realistic, and definitely not to this scale.

“I know you all want to get to know each other, so I’ll keep this short.” Jean grabbed my attention away from all the other festival goers around me. “This year, we will have optional games and events to encourage mingling and to try and keep things fresh and exciting. I implore you to check our chat often and come to these events! There will be at least one each week for the next 8 weeks. If you don’t already have our app, discreetly named Wave Time, there are directions on how to download in on the back of your rule packet. Does anybody have any questions?”

After a few moments of awkward silence, Jean continued. “Alright then, Jerry and I are on the first floor in room 101 if you have any questions. Have fun, stay safe, and stay wet!”

Just as people began to disperse and mingle, Jerry spoke up. “There are free condoms in each common room in the desk drawer, behind the front desk, as well as in most common spaces. Here, they are in this podium. If we run out, please let us, or the front desk attendant on duty, know.”

I felt arousal deep in my core once again, looking about the room again as people reacted to that statement. People were already flirting, shifting back and forth to try and hold it better. Tired, from all the traveling, I decided to go upstairs to my room, and maybe just mingle with my suitemates for now. I changed in a loose black tanktop and lumberjack plaid sweatpants to be more comfortable for bed.

Alexa was in the common room, in a silk, black pajama set. The shorts were loose and very short, and the black button up had gold buttons, also loose fitting, but she only had it buttoned up partially. She was clearly still wearing a bra, as she had amazingly perky cleavage that drew me in like a moth to a flame. Her hair was back in a messy bun, and she was now wearing black, square framed glasses as she watched TV.

“Hey beautiful.” She patted the couch beside her. “Come sit.”

Again having me feeling underdressed, I sat beside Alexa, who was watching what appeared to be Master Chef. “You like cooking shows?”

“Love them. I’m actually a private chef for Jerry and Jean, which is how I can afford so much time off from work to be here.”

“Oh, wow that’s really impressive. Are they nice to work for?”

Alexa nodded, her eyes on the frantic chefs on screen. “Yeah, they’re great, kids are too. The whole family is wonderful, they treat me like one of their own and pay me really well, too. What do you do, my dear Abigail?”

“Well, I’m a bartender after school, but I’m studying to be a veterinarian. I just love animals so much.” Alexa smiled at me, waiting for me to continue. “Uh, are you single?” Well, that was subtle, Abby.

Thankfully, Alexa laughed, playfully slapping my shoulder. “You’re so cute! Yes, I am. I live with Jerry and Jean, and honestly I love the freedom to do as I please, especially here. This is only my third year, but I’d hate to have to change my lifestyle so much if my partner didn’t understand, yknow?”

“Yeah, I get it.” A live in personal chef, and the capabilities to put on an event like this? They must be rich.

“Are you?” Alexa met my eyes, before turning to the opened door from 626 C.

I turned my head to see who our other suitemate was, and boy was I never so excited to give this answer before in my life. “Yes, I am.”
