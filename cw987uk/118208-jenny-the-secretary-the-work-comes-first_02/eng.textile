Hey all

There is a new chapter up, posted Thursday but, for some reason, it is requiring approval 😞 If anyones knows why that might have happened, would love to know!

Not sure how it works when other stuff has been posted after, but it should be at the bottom pf page 1 when/if it gets approved.

Many thanks to all those that have posted or liked this, it is awesome to know that people have enjoyed my story so far!

The next part has been approved!

It is at the bottom of page 1, The Next Day - Part 2!

I am working on the next part as well, it might be a while, I am trying to keep it interesting as this is the most I have written for a story!
