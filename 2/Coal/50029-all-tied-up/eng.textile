Hello!! This a Nagito fanfic I’ve started.

The cuffs around his wrists were starting to hurt, and Nagito’s skin was turning red. The ropes that bound his legs together were a little too tight, and his left leg had pins and needles. After a little while, Nagito felt a pressure in his lower abdomen. Nothing unbearable, but unable to move, and all alone, it was undoubtedly going to become that way eventually. Was this bad luck? Nagito wondered. Maybe this would stop him from getting murdered. Or, maybe a classmate would take advantage of his vulnerable state and kill him. Maybe they would all forget about him and he would die of thirst. Who would be the culprit then? Everyone? Water would be good right now.. Nagito clicked his dry tongue against the roof of his mouth. A nice glass of cool water.. the image drew his mind back to his bladder. Still not noteworthy, but irksome with no distraction. Soon, Nagito fell into a bored slumber.

When Nagito awoke, the pressure in his bladder had doubled. This had without a doubt been what had woken him up, and he felt himself wiggle involuntarily. With his legs and arms bound, Nagito realized there was not much he could do to lessen the urge. He could only shift slightly, and rock back and forth. Nagito sighed, this would be helios. He supposed trash like him deserved to feel like this.
