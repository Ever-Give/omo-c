Hi guys!

I wrote a book (more like compiled it from the stories I've posted here) and now it's available on Kindle ("Half Empty? Half Full" by Stephen Gloucester). Apart from what already exists on the forum, it has one new story, about the girl who was the main character here

.

I'd appreciate it immensely if you buy it and support my writing, but I'm also giving it away for free, because I don't believe in that copyright crap and all. I do believe in generous donations from readers, though

Have a perfect day everyone,

Shameless plugger out
