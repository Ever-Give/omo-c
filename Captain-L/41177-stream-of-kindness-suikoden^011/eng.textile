"Wow... There are very few people coming around, aren't there?"

Lilin stood behind a bar counter, though not in any work capacity. Actually serving patrons was Louise's job, what few there were. Though they were located in the Kingdom of Obel, they were not in the island's main town. They were situated in a small cave on the cliffside adjacent to Obel's Royal Palace, one that had been never been used in what seemed like years. Now, however, the king had offered it to Lazlo, a disgraced Knight of Gaien, to gather allies in opposition of Kooluk Empire. Lilin herself had met Lazlo when he, along with two of his fellow knights and a merchant Nay-Kobold, washed up on the island where she lived, and joined him when he drove off the fishermen of the Cray Trading Company who would sell her skin. Mermaids were very valuable on the black market.

She felt her swim bladder grow tight as she thought of Lazlo; he was a nice, dependable guy, he'd surely win many others over to his side. But that would take time, so as of now, this cave hideout base was mostly empty. Lilin had nothing to do, aside from fiddling behind the counter in the process of making a seashell necklace. She'd look up in the hopes that someone else would have come in every minute.

She was lonely, that much was true. Without her mermaid sisters around, she didn't know anyone and didn't have anyone to talk to. And her skillset was limited, there just wasn't anything she could do to help out. Time seemed to move at a fraction of the speed when she was bored and could only just stand around.

She had nothing to distract herself from the tedium, or from something else. She felt as if an eternity had passed, that was obviously exaggerating, but it really had been a long time, and her aquatic body had taken note. Louise had done her part by occasionally pouring a pitcher of water on Lilin to keep her hydrated, that kept her healthy, but it also had its side effects. So many fluids in her system, while necessary for her survival, were eventually filtered through and necessitated release thusly.

Lilin wasn't used to holding her pee. She spent so much of her life in the water, where her bodily fluids were birthed, it was where they would return to in the end. Meaning, if she ever felt that little urge to tinkle, out it came in a warm cloud. The mermaid had not developed even the slightest bladder strength thanks to that complacency. Big sister Lilon had told her not to be lazy, but it was just so convenient.

But she wasn't in the water now. She was on dry land, far from the ocean, becoming desperate to make a puddle with her piddle. Without the ocean surrounding her to diffuse the yellow fog, she couldn't just let go without making a big mess on the floor, and that would be rude. She couldn't make someone clean up after that kind of thing...and she didn't want to have to do it herself.

She couldn't hold out forever, not very long at all, so she'd have to act soon. Time was already running a little low, judging by the way she was unconsciously keeping her legs touching together. The only thing she could do was run down to the shore and "take a quick swim". And she'd have to do so without hesitation if she didn't want to lose it. But she still found it difficult to speak up. "Miss Louise, the mermaid will-"

Whatever she was going to say, it was soon interrupted by the door to the saloon slamming open, and in the frame stood Cedric, bill-skipper extraordinaire. "The Kooluk Empire is here! Everybody get ready!" With the message delivered, he ran off, eager to save his own skin.

Lilin sprung up at the announcement. It wasn't that she was expecting this, everyone in this little rebel entourage had been told by King Lino En Kuldes that this would happen soon, it was just a little nerve-wracking to know it was now. Not made any easier by her not knowing what would happen next. Okay, she herself wasn't told directly by the king, she had heard a portion of the information second-fin.

There was one thing she knew, however: whenever a shark approached, the school of fish would scatter. Likewise, if a human predator was arriving, the best way to survive would be to escape, and that would mean being as fast as her sea legs could carry her. So, she scampered out from behind the bar, jumping into a run.

That lasted two steps before she slid to a halt, shivering and squealing. She had forgotten that her biggest predicament just a minute earlier was the possibility that she may wet herself, and was reminded by a sudden tidal surge hitting her hard. She very nearly slammed her scaly legs together and buried her hands between them, but she maintained her composure, just barely. She definitely looked a little worried in her big blue eyes, nothing out of the ordinary given the circumstances, but she kept her pee need secret, for the time being.

Still, she needed to pee very badly, and that required attending to. Lucky for her, both problems could be solved in the same way: if she could get to the ocean, she could easily swim away from the Kooluk, and do her business at the same time. She just had to make it down off the cliff and into the ocean. And if she wanted to make it in time, she needed to hurry that way, which started with her making a mad dash for the front door of the saloon in the chaos.

No sooner had Lilin stepped out of the more developed section of the cave, into a standard rocky cavern, that she dropped any pretense of modesty. Her hands, clad with the rest of her upper body in a full white skintight wetsuit, zoomed between her legs and pressed down on her "delicate coral". She found she had nothing to worry about yet, her groin was only damp and not soaked, so she hadn't leaked.

Still, she needed to hurry, down to that endless blue expanse that greeted her eyes as she stepped out of the stone cavity into the light of day. And all the hostile ships that filled that water. True, from a distance, there was nothing that outwardly gave away their hostility, but she could just feel their aura. Of course, once she was in the water, she could escape them in a flash.

She'd need to get down there first, and that wasn't as simple as just jumping down. The cliffside was high above sea level, and while the water was deep enough for ships to dock without an extended pier, it wouldn't be safe to jump from here. There was a middle stroke necessary here, though she wasn't too happy about it. "I need to walk down to the water, then." Just the thought caused a squeak to rise in her gills, her muscles to stiffen, and her heart to drop. Still, she hurried towards the royal palace, the first step on the road to the harbor.

That first step would also turn out to be her first rest stop on the trek. No sooner did she arrive at the gates of the palace, hands still between her blue legs, did she have to stop and double over forward. "Mhgh... Will the mermaid really last until she reaches the water?" The cliff path was a bit on the long side, and it was a nerve-wracking trip for someone so inept at fighting, with a few monsters lurking about.

But she had made it this far. She had made it to the palace and blindly stepped into one of the shallow pools in the courtyard, feeling her foot swish in the lukewarm water. Yet, despite this, a chill ran up her spine, and she froze with one foot in the bath. Just that sensation of wetness on her foot, even if it didn't even reach her ankles, was enough to practically destroy her. After all, it was water, both the wonderful end goal of her search and the terrible reason for the search.

"I suppose...I was simply looking for water..." The pool was shallow, but if she really parked her butt down, she could get her little oyster just below the surface and covertly do her business. She couldn't turn her gaze from the clear water, thinking how she could pollute it. Her mouth practically started watering at the possibility of relief so close, and her other foot found its way in. The fins on the backsides of her shins wiggled in anticipation of the bliss that would soon follow.

She had begun to crouch down, when a sound rose from the town below, one of worry and oncoming danger. "Oh, right... The Kooluk are here..." She had sort of forgotten, but there were more reasons to hurry to the ocean besides just the real threat of busting wide open. She couldn't waste time, not just for herself, but because she might get left behind if she dawdled. However everyone else was escaping, they could do it without her, and she couldn't let that happen.

But first she'd need to drag herself from the tempting pull of these pools. She had to squeeze her eyes shut, and only then she could delicately step out of the tepid water. That was a bad idea. For a brief moment, with her sight cut off, with a lull in the chaos, the only mermaid sense of hers to be stimulated was the feeling of stale fluids around her feet, being slowly absorbed into her aquatic system, as if she wasn't already retaining more than enough water. And the feeling of water hated loneliness, yearning to add to its ranks.

"Eep!" It didn't even look like it was planned, but Lilin leapt out of the pool and landed gracefully on the hard pavement beside it. It would have actually looked elegant, were it not immediately followed by the fiercest squeezing of the crotch, straining her muscles so hard that it seemed she would wring the water from her body like a sea sponge. Were she only so lucky. No, just because she tensed didn't mean anything was coming out. That was a little good, but she really needed to get it out, now. "T-this mermaid can't waste any time! I'm gonna leak!" With her hands acting as a quivering dam, Lilin floundered down the stairs, into the proper Obel town.

###

The town of Obel was both very simple, and very confusing. It was broken into several small districts, defined by the types of business that were conducted in each segment, all connected. The problem was, to the untrained visitor, many of these streets looked quite identical, making distinguishing between them challenging. Were it a straight line to the harbor, this would hardly matter to the one-stream mind of the mermaid, but there were snaking roads and split paths, some that would lead deeper into the town, and some that would circle around back up to the palace.

This was most likely the reason Lilin soon found herself lost. "H-have I passed here already?" The rows of buildings all looked so similar, and the only distinguishing characteristics they displayed were small boards, each adorned with scribbles unfamiliar to the mermaid. The scribbles were different per building, but she still couldn't tell them apart.

The search was taking too long, that was the fact. Lilin had gone up and down countless sets of stairs, but if she had fallen asleep at the start and washed up here, she would have thought she hadn't moved. The only clue that she had gotten somewhere was the sound of the ocean waves, sounding a little different. Whether she was closer, she couldn't say.

The one thing she knew for absolute certain was just how waterlogged she felt. And that would have been bad enough if said water wasn't constantly fighting her, bogging her down, not allowing her to remove her hands from between her legs, not even for a second. The poor mermaid was about to flood, or collapse from the exertion of not flooding.

"I think I made a mistake not doing it earlier..." If she could do it again, Lilin would unhesitatingly pee in that pool up by the royal palace. But she couldn't just go back up there now, not when she was so close to the end. Or maybe she was closer to the top, she didn't know. But going back now would just get her lost even more, so pressing forward was all she could do.

It wasn't possible to stop along the way, either, she was discovering. It was a bit crass to admit, but with every step she took, Lilin checked everywhere, swept her gaze, but being in the domain of land-dwellers, there was no water to be found, just nowhere she could possibly take a pee. So, the ocean was her only chance, lest she make an ocean herself. But she'd probably be fine, so long as she took it slow and wasn't startled.

"You! Weird girl, stop!" A small contingent of Kooluk troops had already come ashore, and were rounding up the residents of the Kingdom of Obel in preparation of their conquest soon-to-come. And now a couple were charging towards Lilin, their weapons already drawn.

As part of a species that had to escape hunters and harvesters frequently, Lilin knew what to do. "Aaahhh, no, this mermaid doesn't want to be fished up by sharks again!" Her fight-or-flight response, the latter half specifically, kicked in, and she bolted in the opposite direction. Even with sea legs, adrenaline carried her swiftly away from the danger, down the first path she could see. She could swear this was where she came from. But that didn't matter; as she ran from possible death, nothing else mattered.

"Eep!" Except for that. No amount of fear could mask the fires of boiling urine so overwhelming that even the vast oceans could not extinguish them. Needless to say, her hands stayed firmly between her scaly thighs, tensed and gripping tight. And with each surge of pain, each pulse of her ballooned bladder pushing its walls outwards, she stumbled and tripped up. Going down stairs, each slip brought with it the split-second fear that she might fall and break her fin.

But she couldn't slow down now, not when the looming failure hung over her, casting a shadow bigger than a killer whale. For the most part, all things considered, Lilin had dome a remarkable job not wetting herself up to now, keeping only as damp as a healthy mermaid on land should be. But that resolve was drying up fast, she just couldn't hold out much longer, and the shock and following exertion were taking their toll. Small squirts of pee, squirting out at irregular intervals, trickled between her clenched fingers and swam down the trails between the scales of her legs. "Ohhhh... I can't... I just can't..."

Her squeals nearly drowned out the noises of the world around her, but being so used to the sound, one thing cut through the tumult and reached her otoliths: crashing waves. They were always audible from somewhere across the island, but this time, it was a lot louder than it had been. In addition, the air turned cool, rife with the smell of salt. It was a scent Lilin could call home, and small tears of relief shone in the corners of her aquamarine eyes. Or they could have been tears born of pain, given that her rock-hard bladder now screamed for relief as it protruded from her stomach.

True to her expectations, her hope, Lilin's view was soon filled with the endless expanse of shimmering blue water, gently caressing the wooden supports of the docks with a pleasing wash. She had done it. She had made it to the pier. If it wouldn't result in a flood equal to the ocean she could practically feel, she would have just relaxed entirely at the wonderful knowledge that she had made it here.

Her, and several ships of Kooluk forces, its men filling the planks of the harbor. And every single one of them was looking at the mermaid, holding her crotch with no shame left, knees knocking and body trembling. Both parties just stared at each other for an uncomfortably long time, long enough to see Lilin double over forward now that nothing distracted her from just how much she was truly bursting.

Smelling her weakness like blood in the water, the front-line soldiers drew their weapons and charged for her, hoping to capture her without a fight. It might have worked, if she weren't a frantic mermaid on an island's port. All she had to do upon seeing the troops approach her was pivot herself away from Obel and jump right into the ocean, straightening her body vertically so as to plunge cleanly below the surface, out of reach of humans. Such a dive was second-nature to a mermaid, but with her desperation-wracked muscles all stiff and difficult to move, it wasn't the easiest.

Gratefully, like a blessing from beyond, that didn't matter anymore. As the salty seawater filled her gills, entered her pores, her body adjusted to the higher pressure pushing inwards, the pressure pushing outwards fizzled away. In her natural habitat, Lilin relaxed, and that included her bladder. With her legs together, arms pressed to her sides, she wriggled her body like an eel to cut through the water, at an excellent clip away from the island and the ships moored at it.

And, of course, her urine suddenly ceased to be a concern. Practically the instant she dove into the chilly water, her body relaxed, a golden cloud began streaking a trail marking her path, warming the route she swam. Her wading motions loosened, looking more boneless and flexible, as her eyes closed and lips pursed. "Hah...phew..."

Her long blonde hair swayed behind her, taking in the warm fog, and a hand found its way to her tummy. She had kept one there for most of the run down, cupping the bloated bladder in her palm, being extremely careful not to jostle it in a way it would never recover from. Not long before now, it had protruded evidently, almost to the size of the two air sacs on her chest. Granted, those sacs were noticeably smaller than a lot of human females she had encountered, but for a bladder to compare, it was agonizing to have it that big. Now, it shrunk by the second in her grasp, no longer straining as the discomfort vanished.

Having relieved herself this exact way many a time, Lilin didn't need to look back to know exactly the sort of mess she was leaving: a bright-yellow mist, shining in the refracted sunlight, slowly dissipating as it floated up towards the surface. To anyone looking, it was painfully obvious that it was the fault of the mermaid peeing, which was why she usually tried to go down deep enough that humans couldn't see her, and why she tried to do it when her sisters wouldn't see.

She hadn't been quite so careful on that first point this time, but that was only because she couldn't manage that much. And she couldn't care, not when it felt so good. "Aahhhhhhh...oohhhhh..." She moaned and gasped several times, slightly indecent noises. She felt her hard piddle sputter in intensity, leaving her little clam quivering in the aftermath. It was bliss. Nice, comfy, warm bliss, relaxing her to the point that her mind started to go blank, and she could just fall asleep here.

First things first, of course, she had to finish peeing, which wasn't that far off. Lilin was not the greatest at holding her pee, so even at this level of desperation, there wasn't that much in her bladder. Her strokes slowed as her flipper feet calmed down, meaning she surrounded herself with the finale of her murky release. It was harder to tell when she had actually finished spraying water when she was surrounded by water, but the lack of contracting muscles in her abdomen told her that tinkle time was over, and she couldn't contain her smile. "Ah, I feel so much better now!" She had never felt so light and hydrodynamic, she spun and performed loops without a care in the world.

She was only stopped by a sudden intense quake, amplified in the water. Strong waves washed overhead from the direction of the island, the vibrations surrounding Lilin, prompting the mermaid to cower and curl up in place. Was this some weapon the Kooluk had brought? Lilin thought she had heard someone talking about a dangerous Kooluk weapon, and if she had to face something like that, she'd be so scared, she'd wet herself.

Yet, she worked up the courage to surface and check it out, rinsing off any pesky urine still stuck to her scales in the ascent. And when she emerged out from the briny sea, she immediately saw why the tide was crazy: half of Obel's cliffside falling away in chunks, each boulder causing a tsunami that swept Lilin away when it reached her, sending her tumbling further with each crash. It got harder to see the ship that was revealed from behind the destruction, right where their hidden base was, sailing out where the Kooluk ships weren't ready for them.

"...oh, I get it! Everybody got on a ship to get away!" She felt a sense of relief wash over her for a second time, knowing that her new friends were safe. And, if she were to stick around, their home base would be one where Lilin could much more easily take a dip when she felt a little dried out. She wouldn't need to hold her pee so long if the ocean was right there for the swimming.

Going back under to gain some distance, Lilin pushed her body hard to build speed, and breached high into the air, flying straight like an arrow until gravity took hold, bringing her sliding onto the ship's deck, greasing up the wooden planks that made up its floor with her soaking wet body. The few people out on the deck, ready at the rune cannons in case Kooluk attempted to stop their escape, were surprised to see a mermaid suddenly land on their ship.

Lilin didn't notice the odd stares she was receiving, not when she was in such a good mood. With a bright smile and dripping form, she made her way into a door leading below deck, out of the way of the action. She wanted to get back to her new friends, to the search for her sisters, and now that she felt so refreshed without an ocean of urine bogging up her system, she could do all that in earnest. And she had a feeling this panicked emergency wouldn't happen again. "This mermaid now knows to take a little break now and again!"
