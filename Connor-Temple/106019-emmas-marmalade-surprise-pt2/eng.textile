Hi guys, here is part 2 of Emma's marmalade surprise. This one goes a bit more in depthüòè hope you enjoy

***

Emma sat hunched forwards, her arms crossed, her face locked in a scowl, for the rest of the journey. The smell of her accident rose up, and she opened her mouth in embarrassed shock, covering it with her hand, her eyes brimming with fresh tears. The coach finally reached school, and Emma made sure she was one of the last off, as so to make sure that virtually no-one caught a whiff of her accident. As she got off the coach, she texted her mum to pick her up as soon as possible, and to cover up the car seats, to which her mum replied "Why?". Emma squeezed her eyes shut for a minute, before typing the words she thought she would never have to type in her life; "Because I've pooped in my knickers."

***

Emma stood facing the wall for a few minutes, trying to avoid eye contact with anyone else and to avoid bumping into anyone as they made their ways to the toilets to relieve themselves. She was so embarrassed. How could this happen to her?! As the cool wind dried her tears on her cheeks, she felt a gentle touch on her arm and an "Excuse me... are- are you alright?". She turned round, and instantly blushed, as she was face to face with the girl that she fancied, who was looking at her in concern.

She was startled, and took a step backwards.

"Oo, sorry, sorry, didn't mean to startle you. I'm Phoebe, I was on the trip."

Emma smiled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, I just had no idea you were there. I'm Emma. And yes, I am fine thank you. What made you ask?"

Phoebe opened her mouth, and then bit her tongue.

"Well... this is a bit sensitive... well, I noticed you walking funny when you got off the coach, and I couldn't help noticing the... well, the smell... of... well, basically - oh, my dear, have you pooed yourself?"

Emma stared Phoebe in the eyes, her own eyes welling with tears again, and nodded, biting her lip to stop herself crying. Phoebe's mouth opened in compassionate shock, which made Emma close her eyes, causing the tears to stream down her face. The floodgates opened again, and she started crying uncontrollably. She felt Phoebe wrap her arms around her, hold her - and then plant a kiss on her forehead.

***

She couldn't believe her senses, and she stood there for several seconds, shocked. She wiped the tears off her cheek with her thumb, trying to comprehend that what had just happened had actually happened! Emma then looked up at Phoebe, who was looking at her. She suddenly became flustered.

"Oh, I was, I was... I was just offering some support, y'know?"

She brushed her ginger locks out of her green eyes, feeling heat grow in her plump cheeks. This lovely lady in front of her was actually incredibly attractive, not just the victim of an awfully embarrassing situation that Phoebe herself would hate to find herself in with no kind of support. Phoebe smiled quickly, though she couldn‚Äôt keep it for long, partly due to her embarrassment, and partly because she was now encountering a terribly familiar sensation. Phoebe had to clench her buttocks together and her bumhole tight, as she felt an urgent sensation in the nerves around her anus, and an increase in pressure in her rectum. She felt a wave of heat, and some moderate emotional discomfort at the worry that she herself might not make it. She shook herself back to Emma though, who she had just kissed so sweetly.

Emma smiled, with a coquettish eyebrow raise, and shook her head. Phoebe looked up at the sky, blushing.

"Oh god-" she started, but Emma cut her off.

"No, no, I'm ok with it. In fact, I was,"

Now it was Emma's turn to blush,

"I was... well, sort-of hoping you'd do it, actually."

Phoebe's eyes lit up, and her mouth opened into a massive grin. But then her face contorted into a pained expression, and she gasped and bent over, clutching her stomach.

"Phoebe, what's the matter? Are you ok?"

There was no reply, as Phoebe remained locked doubled over, gasping short, quick gaps for air between periods of silence, as if trying to ignore whatever sensation was making her react like this was coupled with periods where she couldn‚Äôt possibly ignore it in quick succession.

Phoebe squeezed her eyes closed and screwed up her face, as although she was fine with making the admission she was about to make, she still felt some embarrassment from it, partly just from the situation itself; and partly because she was about to admit something rather embarrassing to a rather gorgeous girl, and one whom she had only just met at that.

"I just really need a shit myself.‚Äù

She decided on blunt honesty.

Emma‚Äôs eyes widened in shock.

‚ÄúI've been clenching for hours and it‚Äôs getting to the point where it‚Äôs a real achey struggle to hold on.‚Äù

Her already pink freckled cheeks seemed to grow even pinker at this last admission.

"Well then, lets go together." said Emma, taking Phoebe's hand. "You can relieve your urge, and I can clean myself up. And then we can discover some more about each other afterwards."

Phoebe thought for a second, and then smiled and stopped resisting Emma's pull, and the two girls walked together in the direction of the toilets.

***

As the two girls made their way to the toilets, Phoebe couldn't help but notice the smell of Emma's poo, the tell-tale tang, but which also had a deep, somewhat sweet scent to it, as she was standing behind and downwind of her, and couldn't help but feel the heat rise in her own cheeks. Her walking slowed a bit as she noticed. Emma turned around, noticing Phoebe slowing, and asked what the matter was.

"I just feel embarrassed for you." said Phoebe.

"I mean, you've had an accident, and I... Well, I can smell the evidence of it and... It just makes me uncomfortable."

Emma smiled.

"Ah, that's sweet Phoebe, but really, I'm fine with it. Everyone has some sort of accident at some point, don't they? I've chosen to consider it as such."

"That's quite healthy then." replied Phoebe, and they continued to the toilets. They approached the door, and Emma gave it a pull, but nothing. Again, and again, nothing. Locked! She looked at Phoebe in horror, whose eyes widened in shock.

"No, no..." Phoebe sobbed, and she sunk to a squat. Suddenly, Emma had a brainwave. She pulled Phoebe up and pulled her along. "We can enter via the languages block!" she exclaimed.

They ran around the corner and tip-toed down the steps. They reached the left door, but their hearts sunk when they realised it was locked. The turned and sprinted across the paving stones to the door on the right, but that was locked as well. Emma turned, her mouth open in shock. Then she had another sudden brainwave.

"The door from the other side!"

"No Emma, I'll have soiled myself by the time we get round there. It‚Äôs at least five minutes away. If we can even get through there."

Emma felt scarlet humiliation grow in her cheeks as Phoebe said the words ‚Äúsoiled myself‚Äù. The girls looked at each other in despair. Phoebe‚Äôs blue eyes pricked with tears. She was holding her gut, her arms making digging motions back and forth across it. But then her bright blue eyes suddenly lit up, and she started back towards the wall.

"Where are you going?" called Emma.

"Trust me." Phoebe called back.

Emma followed Phoebe, frowning as she wondered why she was walking back this way. She felt slightly awkward walking, as her poo weighed her knickers down, and she felt the sheer mass of them, slightly lowered as she walked. She had to do a kind of waddle to balance out the weight that she was worried might pull her knickers down and cause the mess to spill into her tights and over her legs.

She tapped Phoebe‚Äôs shoulder.

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù She said. Phoebe turned to look at her.

‚ÄúI feel like a kinda shitty penguin.‚Äù

Phoebe looked at her walk some more, and a grin started to break it on her face.

Emma grinned back. As unfortunate as her accident had been, it could be worse - and could still get worse - if what she feared about her mess spilling out happened. Phoebe led them up the slope and back to the wall and placed her bag on it, then turned to face Emma.

"You understand how... how desperate times call for desperate measures?". Emma nodded. Phoebe turned to her bag, hesitated for a second, and then dug her hand in her bag and pulled out a sparkly turquoise potty. She turned to Emma, who was frowning in confusion.

"It's not for me." said Phoebe in explanation, smiling.

"I was originally meant to pick my sister up from nursery after we got back, and - well, she doesn't like going for a... a number two at nursery. She's uncomfortable about it." Emma nodded.

"So was I." she said.

"So" Phoebe continued "when me or my mum go to pick her up, we take this with us, just in case she's needed to go during the day and hasn't been able to. Then we can supervise her and she can relieve herself and she doesn‚Äôt have to be desperate till we get home." Emma nodded again. "Understandable. I used to hate pooing at school. I even had an accident once because I held it in for too long. Did you ever poo yourself at school?"

"Not that I remember." replied Phoebe, setting the potty on the wall. "Although I did wet myself several times because I was desperate in class and the teacher wouldn't let me go." Emma nodded again.

‚ÄúAlso - number two, Phoebe?‚Äù

Phoebe blushed at Emma‚Äôs pointing out of her rather informal choice of words.

‚ÄúI guess I felt a little embarrassed by the whole situation, so I kinda slipped into informal language. That and not wanting to acknowledge what it actually is, with needing to go so badly myself.‚Äù

Emma smiled kindly at Phoebe. She gave her a warm smile back, noting her full, kind face, her warm brown eyes, her smooth, silky, chocolate coloured hair. Phoebe let out a flustered laugh, dropping the potty over the wall and onto the grass verge behind it. Her cheeks felt crimson.

"Oh shit!"

"oo, I've got a torch on my phone." Said Emma.

"Cheers." Replied Phoebe, as Emma went round the wall to find the potty.

Bracing herself against the brick wall as she went down the bank behind the wall, Emma fumbled and accidentally changed to her camera, thus closing the torch app. Her heart was racing. Was she about to see a girl in the act of pooing? Would this girl actually make it? Phoebe was resting both hands on the wall, head down, but now looked up.

"What the fuck are you doing?" she said. She was flustered with her desperation and now the worry of it overcoming her.

"Sorry, I accidentally closed it." said Emma, as she found the torch again and tuned it on. She found the potty and rushed back round, handing it to Phoebe, whose breathing was sharp and rushed. She slammed it onto the wall as Emma turned round to face her. Phoebe's marmalade freckles were shiny and slick with sweat, as the effort of holding it in almost became too much. She hurriedly pulled down the zip of her skirt and pulled it down. She was now only in her tights, and Emma could see through them to her white knickers, covered in multi-coloured spirals. Phoebe yanked the tights down, struggling as her sweat stuck them to her skin.

"Fuck!" she shouted, her heart racing. There were tears in her eyes. She was worried she wouldn‚Äôt make it.

"Don't panic Phoebe. You can do it." Emma said.

Phoebe tugged on them, slowly pulling them off. She started to pull her knickers off, but through a combination of desperation making her mind spin, and sweat sticking them to her skin, she couldn‚Äôt actually get them off, and they twisted into a crumpled mess around her thighs.

‚ÄúUuh- uh-huh-huuuh!‚Äù Phoebe cried. If she went now, even though her knickers were off the areas they usually covered, her poo and wee would fall right onto them. Her face contorted in an uncomfortable expression with her cheeks pulled apart but her lips kept together, utter desperation filling her. Emma‚Äôs eyes widened as now that Phoebe had her pants off, she could smell for certain the scent which she thought she had caught a whiff of before; Phoebe‚Äôs pussy. It was a thick musk, which reminded her of her own but was noticeably different, with a sharp tang of sweat for a kick.

‚ÄúUwwwwurrgh!‚Äù

Phoebe shocked herself now. She had never heard herself make the noise she had just let out before. It was a primal groan of utter desperation. Her face contorted again into the expression with her cheeks pulled apart but her lips kept together, as she worried her control was finally about to give up.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre almost there! You‚Äôre almost there baby!‚Äù She heard Emma say.

Phoebe took strength in this, and although it caused a rush of embarrassed heat to spread through her cheeks fast, she also felt touched at being called baby. She took a breath in, then pushed her knickers straight down, pushing them off. Emma realised just how wet her labia were now. Phoebe got her feet up onto the wall, squatted over the potty and finally relaxed.

Her sphincter finally opened and - ‚Äúskkrlurrrooch‚Äù - she felt a moderate sized piece of poo be released into the potty, followed by several others. A short spurt that slowed to a short trickle of wee squirted into the potty alongside it. Phoebe shivered as she felt what felt like an electric charge surge through her, the hairs on her arms standing on end and the ones on her head feeling like they were. She had longed for this feeling since she had been at the museum. Longed for it so so soooo much. Emma moved to the side, to provide more direct light and to get a better view of Phoebe relieving herself. She saw Phoebe's bum hanging over the potty, and saw the remaining space become less and less as Phoebe defecated into it. Her bumhole was stretched by a large but soft sausage of poo. Phoebe's mouth opened and her face softened into an open mouthed expression of pure relief. Her blue eyes brimmed with tears.

As the large yet soft sausage was squeezed out, it sent a surge up a nerve in her bumhole and she gasped, unexpected additional pleasure on top of the pleasure of relief. She finally noticed that her bladder was pretty full too, and so she relaxed control and felt a high pressure stream of urine shoot into the potty. She sighed with relief as her head flung back. After about half a minute, the pressure subsided as Phoebe's bladder emptied, and her stream dribbled down to a trickle.

As she pee‚Äôd, Emma noticed the scent of her pussy again, and blushed as she seemed to enjoy it, and it was possibly even turning her on slightly. ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs true.‚Äù Emma thought to herself about all girl‚Äôs pussys smelling different. She shook her head. She couldn‚Äôt quite believe her eyes. She couldn‚Äôt believe how beautiful the scene in front of her was. This beautiful redhead squatting over a receptacle meant to be used by those who hadn‚Äôt learnt to use a proper toilet yet. Her pants, skirt and tights around her ankles. Her beautiful face, marmalade coloured freckles, plump round cheeks, slick with sweat, and gasping after such a desperate ordeal and such longed-for relief. She stared longingly at Phoebe's labia, pink, wet, glistening, her labia minora hanging past her labia majora.

***

Phoebe closed her eyes in ecstasy, and the tears that had welled in them cascaded down her freckled cheeks.

"Got here just in time." said Emma with an exasperated sigh, screwing up her face at the smell of her own and Phoebe's excrement.

"Oh, you have no idea." replied Phoebe.

"I was worried I wouldn't make it, I felt like I was gonna burst! Thanks for the light by the way; I don't particularly enjoy the thought of doing a poo in total darkness."

Emma smiled.

"That's quite alright." she said. She sat on the wall next to Phoebe and held her phone to her side, illuminating the potty and Phoebe's bum & vagina. Mistake. Emma‚Äôs mouth opened in shock and she sighed, as she had forgotten there was a whole poo in her pants. It now squashed over her buttocks again, soft and thick, and gooey. She had thought it had covered the majority of them before, but now, it reached places that it had not before.

Phoebe heard it squelch, and her mouth opened in embarrassed shock.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright. I‚Äôve gotten used to it by now. Said Emma.

‚ÄúIn fact,‚Äù she continued, a slight emotional discomfort in her belly as she realised these feelings, ‚Äúit‚Äôs‚Ä¶ actually kinda‚Ä¶ enjoyable.‚Äù

Phoebe‚Äôs eyes widened at this.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ soft‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs really warm‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs gotten warmer again since I sat down.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs cheeks were on fire as she made this admission and as she came to the realisation herself.

Phoebe looked off into the distance for a few seconds, before tilting her head up then down in a nod and letting out a ‚ÄúHm.‚Äù as if she had both come to a decision and agreement.

‚ÄúWell‚Äù she said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs always good to find out what you like. Doesn‚Äôt matter how taboo it is.‚Äù

Emma thought for a second, then tilted her head while pursing her lips and letting out the same kind of ‚ÄúHmm.‚Äù of agreement as Phoebe had a minute previously. Emma drifted back to the present, and her holding the torch for Phoebe. She looked at her lower half, squatting over the potty. Her eyes widened as she then noticed the freckles covering Phoebe's bumcheeks, and she felt herself become ever wetter.

"Your... bum is... is freckled."

Phoebe smiled.

"Yes, it is. Most of my legs are as well."

She noticed Emma's wide eyes.

"D'you like them, then? You a freckle lovin‚Äô kinda gal?". Phoebe smiled.

Emma nodded, and stared at them. She moved the torch down Phoebe's legs, and found she was right; she found a sea of orangey-brown freckles. She was entranced by them. She reached out to touch Phoebe‚Äôs legs, not even noticing at first. The cool breeze was blowing the musty, fairly tangy and slightly sweaty scent of Phoebe‚Äôs genitals into Emma‚Äôs nostrils. It made her heart race. She then paused, unsure as to whether to continue or not. She locked eyes with Phoebe, who reached a hand out to Emma's cheek. She slowly moved her face forwards, pressing her lips against Emma's. Her other hand flew to Emma's cheek, and the pair's faces exploded with heat, and a rush of oestrogen & adrenaline.

***

Emma's left hand slowly moved lower down Phoebe's right leg, before reaching her private parts. She moved her fingers across the wet labia, tracing a semicircle at the top, stroking the labia and Phoebe‚Äôs clitoral hood over her clitoris as well. Phoebe‚Äôs mouth opened in surprised pleasure, leading Emma to taste her breath. Luckily, it wasn‚Äôt particularly unpleasant; it actually just tasted quite normal, Emma thought to herself. ‚ÄúAnd intimate.‚Äù, she thought. So so so intimate.

She continued tracing Phoebe‚Äôs clitoris for several minutes with her fingers, before they slipped inside her vagina. She began rooting around inside, feeling the tight muscular ridges. Phoebe's breathing started to quicken as Emma's fingers worked against the tightness, stimulating her. Emma curled her fingers up and down, working against Phoebe's vagina. She rubbed her clitoris with her thumb. Phoebe moved off the potty onto the wall, moving the potty onto the ground. Emma now stopped kissing and fingering Phoebe though and held her hands to her mouth, as the stench of Phoebe's exposed bottom flooded the air. She smelt her fingers, and the musky scent of Phoebe's vagina pervaded her nostrils.

"Oh, I'm sorry." Phoebe said.

"Here, I have some tissues." Said Emma, reaching into her bag.

"Cheers." Said Phoebe, taking the tissues and taking one out to wipe her bottom. She lay on her back on the wall bending up, wiping her dirty bumhole.

Emma took the opportunity to go a bit further with Phoebe. She nestled her phone in her bag and reached up to gently pull off Phoebe's jumper. Phoebe raised her arms to allow Emma to pull it off, and shook her hair about as it came off. This made Emma blush, and really turned her on. She then moved to pull off Phoebe's polo shirt, and did so, revealing her moderately sized breasts, squashed together by a multi-coloured polka dot bra.

After a few minutes Phoebe finished wiping, and there was a pile of dirty tissues on the ground. Her labia were still wet though, even though she had wiped them. Phoebe looked at them, then at Emma, who rushed to embrace her again. Her hand again slowly moved down Phoebe's left leg, before finding her private parts and gently slipping inside. Phoebe took a sudden deep breath in, and started to breathe quicker and quicker as Emma stimulated her.

***

Several minutes of hot, passionate yet gentle kissing later, Emma now had a thought; she had wondered what pussy tasted like. So she took her fingers out of Phoebe's vagina and slid her round, so that she was lying on the wall again facing her. She swung her leg over so that she was straddling the wall.

"What's wrong?" Phoebe said in concern, but Emma held out a hand, and put her finger in her mouth and slowly sucked it. An explosion of sour, musky flavour filled her mouth, and she slowly bent down in front of Phoebe.

Phoebe felt her heart rate quicken even more as the anticipation of what was to come increased. Emma put her face in front of Phoebe's vagina, taking a deep breath. The strong, musky scent pervaded her nostrils, and she felt her arousal increase. She stuck her tongue out and licked Phoebe's labia. She placed her hands on her large thighs and licked up continuously. Phoebe felt a tingle throb up her clitoris every time the bumps on Emma's tongue rubbed against it, making her tense her legs and her core. Her freckled face was filled with an intense burning heat, and beads of sweat streaked down her cheeks.

Phoebe could still smell Emma's faeces, and she was rather embarrassed as, much to her own surprise and as she had realised earlier, but been too embarrassed to say, the scent... seemed to arouse her further. She had never encountered any unpleasant smell giving her sexual pleasure before, but there was something about this girl‚Äôs waste, which she would obviously have preferred to dispose of in private and into a receptacle to dispose of, that gave her a buzz. She stared down the body of the girl who was eating her out, noting quite a noticeable bulge in the back of her pleated black school skirt. This made her pussy lips wetten even more. She looked down at the potty filled with her golden liquid, and wondered what it would be like... to feel it. Or, to be precise, to feel Emma's, on her face. Phoebe froze, her gentle grinds of pleasure coming to a halt as she realised what she was now contemplating. What if she was made Emma‚Äôs toilet? Just once‚Ä¶

Emma notice that Phoebe had stopped gently grinding her hips, and so looked up, and then stopped licking when she noticed Phoebe‚Äôs facial expression. She got up a bit. Her mouth was reeling from the taste of Phoebe‚Äôs pussy. It was full of tangy musk, and reeled a bit as if she had been drinking something sour. Sour yet delectable. She licked the remnants off her lips as they were annoying her, leading to even more enjoyment.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, Phoebe? I could feel that you were enjoying it, but then what I felt‚Ä¶ changed.‚Äù

Emma blushed a little - this was her first sexual encounter with another girl, after all, and she wasn‚Äôt a hundred percent sure how to behave or how to handle Phoebe, in a sense. She felt butterflies in her tummy - she really hoped she hadn‚Äôt done something wrong.

Phoebe looked up, a bead of sweat running down her forehead.

‚ÄúEh- Emma.‚Äù She stuttered.

Emma‚Äôs butterflies increased at Phoebe‚Äôs hesitation, and she felt them lead to a gurgle in her tummy. She tried to hold it in, but the butterflies caused the little bit of poop that had arrived in her rectum since she had accidented to squirt out into her pants. Her cheeks filled with heat, and her hand rushed to her mouth, her eyes starting to prick with tears. Her nerves were starting to rekindle her shame at having such a big, messy accident.

‚ÄúOh my god - oh, baby!‚Äù Exclaimed Phoebe as she heard the squelch of Emma‚Äôs fresh defecation. Emma sniffed, holding back tears. Phoebe instantly reached out a caring hand to Emma‚Äôs head, caressing her hair.

‚ÄúDid- di- did I do something‚Ä¶ wr-wr- wrong?‚Äù Emma stammered, starting to cry again.

‚ÄúAwww, baby! God no!‚Äù Phoebe replied, opening her legs either side of the wall to get nearer Emma and holding her, wrapping her arms around her.

‚ÄúGod no.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou-you-j-just‚Ä¶ paused after you were-eh-enjoying it so-m- m- much‚Ä¶ I thought I must have done something wrong!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo baby, nothing of the sort.‚Äù

Phoebe stroked Emma‚Äôs arm and her hair. She planted a warm kiss on her forehead.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a wonderful, wonderful girl, and I would never make you feel you‚Äôd done something wrong during something intimate like this. I mean, I don‚Äôt even view it as being ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, I mean sure we can end up doing things other people don‚Äôt like if we don‚Äôt know they don‚Äôt like ‚Äòem, but then we just politely let them know. And that isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs happened here anyway.

Phoebe gave Emma a big kiss on the lips.

‚ÄúWell- well then‚Äù Emma said, composing herself and speaking through her own and Phoebe‚Äôs saliva, ‚Äúwhy did you pause?‚Äù

Phoebe looked at Emma, then quickly down at her crotch and legs, feeling her own shame fill her.

‚ÄúI paused because‚Ä¶ I paused because, well, I‚Äôm really enjoying the smell of your dump‚Äù Emma‚Äôs eyes widened and her head cocked to the side slightly, a slight smile playing on her lips, ‚Äúand, cos, like you earlier, when you realised you were enjoying sitting in your dump,‚Äù Emma blushed at this, but smiled, ‚ÄúI- I realised I was feeling my own‚Ä¶ unconventional urge when I looked at the potty‚Ä¶ and- and then your bulge.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs eyes slowly widened.

‚ÄúI felt, when I looked at your bulge when you were eating me, a... rush, like... like I became even more aroused.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs eyes seemed to widen even more, and then she looked at Phoebe, her face slowly breaking into a slightly open-mouthed grin of pleased surprise.

‚ÄúGo on then.‚Äù She whispered, now tracing Phoebe‚Äôs clit again. Phoebe‚Äôs mouth opened in pleasure, and she struggled, through pleasure and shame, to get the words out.

"Emma... Do you think that you could... If you.. Don't mind..." she managed between deep breaths of pleasure, "e-empty your... B-b-b-bladder onto my face?". Emma stopped playing with her out and stared at her. Phoebe's eyes contained a twinkle, and a slightly upset, begging expression on her freckled face.

Emma‚Äôs eyes widened.

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt it be quite hot, and‚Ä¶ dirty‚Äù she put emphasis on ‚Äúdirty‚Äù, if you used me as your toilet?‚Äù

Emma didn‚Äôt think her eyes could widen anymore, but, alas, they did. She stared for a few more seconds, and then shrugged. "Why not? Yeah, my bladder's pretty full." She got off the wall and stood on it, facing Phoebe's feet. Phoebe smelt the stench of Emma's accident, the tang pervading her nostrils, causing her labia to become wetted even more. Emma looked at Phoebe's face, her round, plump cheeks, her marmalade freckles glistening with sweat, her eyes filled with a deep longing. Emma smiled, and moved her buttocks closer to Phoebe's face, and then up again, even further than before. Phoebe tensed at this, anticipating the onslaught. Emma turned, facing Phoebe, and rubbed her thighs together like she was desperate to pee. Phoebe moaned. Emma lowered herself, rubbing her thighs together and then rose yet again, this time unzipping her skirt and slipping it off as she went up. Phoebe moaned.

"Please Emma, just do it!"

Emma looked down at this, and smiled. She pulled off her tights, swinging them around and then dropping them on phoebe's face. A dull scent of faeces and intimate area filled her nostrils and she looked up, as Emma gently tucked her thumbs into the pants. Phoebe's breathing rate was so fast she thought she might pass out. Emma slowly pulled the knickers off now, and then peeled them down and off completely. Her grey labia were wet with lubrication, and her clitoris was hanging. Emma stepped over Phoebe's face and squatted down, her pussy hovering over Phoebe, and finally relaxed.

A torrent of urine cascaded onto Phoebe's freckled face, smothering the golden freckles. Emma‚Äôs mouth fell open and her head fell back, ‚ÄúHuh‚Äù a grin started to appear on her face. Phoebe gasped and rushed her hands to her face, plastering the excrement all over. The thick, acrid scent filled her nostrils. Emma looked over at her, her eyes wide in surprise. Phoebe's face was covered in urine.

Emma knelt down now, and went back down Phoebe's body. She went to her knees, and gently licked up the legs to her pussy. She inserted her tongue and went in and out fast, rubbing the clitoris on the way in and brushing it with force on her way out. The lubrication filled her mouth, a sour cocktail that she gulped down. Phoebe felt her core tense, as her breathing increased even more. She started moaning, moving her hips forwards and backwards. She was near the edge. Ten seconds later, and her clitoris erupted in a blaze of passion.

"Uuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhh". Phoebe let out a moan that was filled with deep pleasure. Emma smiled at this. Phoebe looked up at her, her breathing still heavy, and smiled at her.

"Thank you.... SO much."

Emma smiled. "That's quite alright." She looked down at herself, her grey, wet labia, her brown, poopy buttocks, and then at Phoebe, her wet, pink labia, her golden face, and then a sudden realisation dawned.

"Oh SHIT... How are we possibly gonna clean this all up before one of our parents gets here?!"
