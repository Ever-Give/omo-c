Been a lurker for a year or two now, so I decided I might try this.

I saw someone writing stories for free in this forum, so I figured I might as well do the same. Don't expect much from me, as I'm not the best writer, but I'm hoping this helps me practice.

Here's a list of stuff I'm comfortable writing about:

- Female Only

- Furries (Optional)

- Just peeing (I might do messing, just not right now)

- Pretty much any scenario (I can write about plenty of different things)

If you have questions then just send a reply.

(It might take me a while to reply, I don't always find time to do this)

This is my first time posting anything here on Omoorg, but I'm hoping I can get a request or two.

That's all 😄

Sounds like a really cool idea, I'll see about doing it.

Thanks, also just curious are you going to write your own stories or use AI to write them?

I might do both, I can't always think of the best ways to keep a story going, so AI could help me along
